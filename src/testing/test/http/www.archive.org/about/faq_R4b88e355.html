<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<P STYLE="font-weight: bold;">Why are there no shows by band X?</P><P>We'd like to make sure that a <a href= "http://wiki.etree.org/index.php?page=TradeFriendly">trade-friendly</a> band would not mind having their shows in the Archive for public download.  The best way for us to find out is by getting permission from a band representative or by the band's having an explicit policy that covers this type of site.  If there are no shows by the band, either we don't have enough of this information to go forward with archiving, they have declined participation, or we are ready to accept shows but no one has uploaded anything yet. (Also, see the <a href= "http://www.archive.org/about/faqs.php#101">band status FAQ</a>).
<br><br>
Trade-unfriendly bands will not be found in the Archive, nor will otherwise trade-friendly bands who have declined to have material archived here.
<br><br>
Bands, see other relevant FAQs <a href= "http://archive.org/about/faqs.php#115">here</a> and <a href= "http://archive.org/about/faqs.php#131">here</a>.
