                    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      Internet Archive (the &quot;Archive&quot;) is committed 
                      to making its constantly growing collection of Web pages 
                      and other forms of digital content (the &quot;Collections&quot;) 
                      freely available to researchers, historians, scholars, and 
                      others (&quot;Researchers&quot;) for purposes of benefit 
                      to the public. The Archive offers access to some of its 
                      Collections mainly by allowing Researchers to access its 
                      Unix machines. This open approach is somewhat like the situation 
                      in a public library, where staff and patrons might see who 
                      else was in the library and a bit of what they were working 
                      on. When Researchers using the Collections log on to the 
                      same Unix machine using different accounts, some sharing 
                      of information may take place. While the Archive endeavors 
                      to enforce its Terms of Use (http://www.archive.org/terms/index.html) 
                      and maintain standard computer security, it is important 
                      for both those who visit the site (&quot;Visitors&quot;) 
                      and Researchers (collectively, &quot;Users&quot;) to be 
                      aware of the open nature of the Archive.</font></p>

                      Because the Archive uses standard Web logging in its Web

                      request, along with a variety of information supplied by 
                      the visitor&#8217;s browser. See www.microsoft.com and www.netscape.com

                      The Archive has no present intention to charge for access

                      provided to third parties, for any use, without limitation. 
                      For instance, parts of the Collections are now in the collections
