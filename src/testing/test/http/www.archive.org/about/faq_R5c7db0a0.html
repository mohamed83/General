<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<P STYLE="font-weight: bold;">What file formats are accepted for contributions to the Live Music Archive?</P><P>Currently, the Live Music Archive will only accept audio files in either of two lossless formats: FLAC (.flac) or Shorten (.shn).  Please Note that MKW files (.mkw) are *NOT* an acceptable file format for your contributions because they lack cross-platform compatibility (Mac users are unable to play or decode MKW files)<br><br>

In addition, please do not upload the lossy files (MP3 or OGG) next to your FLAC or SHN format files - the Archive <a href= "http://www.archive.org/about/faqs.php#236">creates</a> those files automatically, provided that the contributor agrees to having them available.  This ensures that all the files here have uniform quality options selected.<br><br>

Please follow etree.org's <a href="http://wiki.etree.org/index.php?page=SeedingGuidelines">Seeding Guidelines</a> when preparing your contributions for addition to the collection.  Pay particular attention to the <a href="http://wiki.etree.org/index.php?page=NamingStandards">Naming Standards</a> section. A well-named identifier helps patrons find your show in our large collection. A well-named set of files allows files to be listed in the proper order at the site, and allows patrons to listen to them in playlists and burn them to CD in the proper order, too.</P><P STYLE="text-align:right;"><A HREF="/about/faqs.php" ONCLICK="javascript:window.opener.location='/about/faqs.php';window.close();return false;">See all Frequently Asked Questions</A></P>
