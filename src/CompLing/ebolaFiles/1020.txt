Nobody will be allowed to leave their house for about for four days beginning September 18.

Sierra Leone announced Friday a four-day countrywide lockdown intended to stop the Ebola outbreak which will be in place September 18 to 21. Local authorities said that the measure is an effort to help health workers isolate Ebola patients to avoid further infections.
"The aggressive approach is necessary to deal with the spread of Ebola once and for all," said Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, a presidential adviser on the country's Ebola task force.
About 21,000 people will be recruited to enforce the lockdown, according to Kargbo.
The disease, which causes hemorrhagic fever, has killed about 2,100 people recently, according to World Health Organization (WHO).
The current Ebola outbreak in several Western African nations is the worst ever since the virus, which kills up to 90 percent of people who contracts it, was discovered in the seventies.
Medecins Sans Frontieres has criticized international community, especially Western nations, over the lack of support to help poor African nations address the Ebola spread.
