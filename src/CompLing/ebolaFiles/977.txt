Liberians United and CommuteAfrika in association with the Liberian Association of Metropolitan Atlanta (LAMA) are sponsoring a "WALKATHON" to honor those who have been affected by the ebola virus, bring awareness and collect donations for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Registration starts at 8:00am and the Walk begins at 9am, Location: 665 Duluth Hwy, Lawrenceville, GA behind the KFC and ends at Rhodes Jordan Park. Preceding the Walk will be an Assembly Ceremony with special invited guests, including Mayor Judy Johnson of Lawrenceville.
