The Irish Savant

When Irish eyes are bleeding






A few posts back I wrote about the latest gift from the Dark Continent, the Ebola virus. There had been a fear that this would spread to Western countries, what with our vibrant local African communities and their penchant for bush meat and so on.  And indeed this terrible outcome seemed to have occurred, with patients from the affected areas arriving in the West and ending up dead in isolation units.  We've even had a case in Donegal, where a man recently returned from Sierra Leone succumbed to the dreaded symptoms.

However you can imagine the relief when it was revealed that the cause of death was not the Ebola virus, rather the Not-Ebola virus. Same thing seems to be happening all over the world so maybe we don't have anything to worry about.

So just to clarify, the symptoms of the Ebola virus are fatigue, fever, joint, muscle and abdominal pain, blood-soaked vomiting and diarrhoea, and  bleeding from every orifice before the unfortunate victim expires after about ten days by dissolving into a bloody mass.

The symptoms of the  Not-Ebola virus on the other hand are fatigue, fever, joint, muscle and abdominal pain, blood-soaked vomiting and diarrhoea, and  bleeding from every orifice before the unfortunate victim expires after about ten days by dissolving into a bloody mass.

So don't worry if you hear about such a case near you.  The likelihood is that it not be the dreaded Ebola virus, rather the Non-Ebola one.  Now back to work.

The 2 US aid workers "cured"...huzzah! Even though experts say that the virus can lay dormant for weeks or months, they're free to go...how long will they be able to keep this swept under the rug, once a serious outbreak happens? It's painfully obvious that health officials would have had zero qualms about enforcing stricter quarantine polices if ebola originated in Europe or Asia...but since niggers carry it, it's racist to do that now...just ask the "news" outlets.http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nn-american-doctor-ebola-20140821-story.html

Know what, those movies like Outbreak are pretty cool.   NOthing like watching blood shooting out of every orifice in bodies with hot nurses in Hazmat Gear running around all hot and sweaty.   Problem with this as opposed to cinema, is we have to wait so long to get to the real excitement.   I'd much rather get the whole fricking thing over with in an hour and 30 minutes than to watch this drag on for months or years on end.

"Why did the queer Irishman get tested twice for AIDS?""To be sure, to be sure"HIV positive men treated like 'lepers' - TCD studyGay Irishmen 'shun' friends who admit they've contracted the virus Irish gay men have reported being shunned by some of their own friends when they reveal that they are HIV positive.SHAREGO TOThe stigma associated with the virus that activists prayed had been consigned to history is back with a vengeance, a new joint Trinity College Dublin study concludes.One HIV infected gay man who took part in the study said negativity from his  peers was so strong when he told them he had tested positive that he felt it would be preferable to have cancer than HIV.The disturbing stigmatisation of the disease comes as new cases of HIV infection among gay men in Ireland are at their highest ever.In 2005 there were 60 newly diagnosed cases. Last year there were 159. Many HIV positive men, faced with odium from their peers, are choosing to keep their illness a secret.Those who reveal their diagnosis to family, friends and sexual partners say the  experience is deeply traumatic.Some HIV sufferers, who opened up to friends, even found themselves publicly outed on social media and banished from their circle of gay friends."Dublin is relatively small and Ireland is relatively small, but Dublin's gay community is smaller still, so when they tell one person it is almost guaranteed that other people are going to find out as well," said Patrick Murphy, lead researcher for The HIV Disclosure Study,"It's almost a double bind, because there is a pressure to disclose, so you are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. They are faced with the moral burden of non-disclosure or a backlash if they act responsibly."http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/health/hiv-positive-men-treated-like-lepers-tcd-study-30531582.html#sthash.BAk3rKj6.dpufDisgusting Homosexual Abomination Vows To Have Sex With Different Person Each Day For A YearThe world under Jew-inspired Cultural Marxism continues to provide moments of absolute shock, with a 26 year old faggot “activist” declaring his intention to have sex with a different person each day for an entire year.Mischa Badasyan, unfortunately a resident of Berlin, claims to be an Armenian of Russian descent, although some sources, including TruTube, have called him out for being a Jew. The behavior this freak is engaged in, topped off by astounding hubris and voyeurism, also tends to support the existence of parasitic DNA.http://www.dailystormer.com/disgusting-homosexual-abomination-vows-to-have-sex-with-different-person-each-day-for-a-year/

@nilus 12:06When the Muslims tried to conquer Europe in the 8th Century but were stopped at Tours, was the aggression the Muslims held towards the Europeans because of the number of we bombs were dropping on them from our planes?It wasn't, was it.This is because Muslims don't hate the West because of bombs. Muslims hate the West because the West is full of non-Muslims, and non-Muslims are an abomination to them.So, stop being so cowardly and gullible - if we stop bombing them, they won't stop bombing us. Stop blindly believing whatever you are told.

.I find St. Nilus's revelations on the doings and the screwings of the joo/fag/nigger dominated Hebe-Bee-Cee absolutely fascinating ... and of course, wonder that anyone in the UK can stand to watch it. This pretty much goes for television anywhere, of course, but the Brits seem to be a particularly egregious example.It's rather like the McMillan quote of sealing off Africa, and then peeping in every ten years or so, to see if anything has changed. I have not watched a television set for about twenty years and feel no compulsion to do so.  It's (to my mind) like setting up a deck chair to view a high-risk train-smash level crossing -- but without the entertainment value.I once read that the aristocracy -- and a fair amount of the plebs -- used to stroll down to Bedlam on a dull day to view the antics of the inmates. This always struck me as far-fetched.But, I now begin to see the thinking behind it.I am sure that the the world is agog with the knowledge that New Zealand is about to suffer a general election and anticipates the outcome with keen interest.The fight -- if one may dignify it with such a title -- will be between the National Party (very-slightly-to-the-right Left Wing) and Labour (very-much-to-the-left Left Wing) ... rather like the UK's Conservative and Labour and the US's Reps and Dems -- and like the aforementioned parties pretty much two sides of the same coin.To my absolute astonishment, I am eligible to vote, and will do so, although the parties that I would vote for (ACT, NZ First or Conservative) do not stand a snowball's hope.Of course they don't ... not yet.Maybe in ten year's time, when the country is 60% Chinese .... but not yet.Interestingly enough, my work takes me to the Auckland International Airport on a regular basis. Over the last week a good deal of the signage, departure/landing info, etc. has become bilingual ... English and Chinese.The thin end of the wedge. Whattaya know.UN.

Former Chief Psychiatrist Says ‘Transgender’ Craze is a Mental DisorderThe “transgender” craze currently being promoted by the controlled mass media as “the next civil rights frontier” is in fact a mental illness and its promotion is aiding and abetting mental disorders, the former chief psychiatrist for the Johns Hopkins Hospital has said.Dr. Paul R. McHugh, who is currently Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at the world-famous hospital, also said that sex changes were “biologically impossible” and that those doctors who “promote sexual reassignment surgery are collaborating with and promoting a mental disorder.”In addition, he said, “transgenderism is a mental disorder that merits treatment” like society would treat other mental disorders, and it should not be catered to by the media or the medical profession in the way that it is.Dr. McHugh, who is the author of six books and at least 125 peer-reviewed medical articles, made his remarks in an article in the WALL STREETJournal titled “Transgender Surgery Isn’t the Solution”, in which he explained that transgender surgery is not the solution for people who suffer a “disorder of ‘assumption’”—the notion that their maleness or femaleness is different than what nature assigned to them biologically.http://www.dailystormer.com/former-chief-psychiatrist-says-transgender-craze-is-a-mental-disorder/Last night I watched Brit Micheal Bisping kick the shit out of Vietnamese Cung Le,he nust have lost easily a pint of blood from the cuts round his eyes, and now Im about to watch the UFC main card from last night, Henderson vs Dosanjos. http://www.tubesports.net/watch-ufc-fight-night-49-henderson-vs-dos-anjos-online-free/I suppose there are more fags in the crowd than at a George Micheal concert, hey, faggot?At least when you are trolling me you arent touching kids.Just yourself.

Liberian Doctor who received experimental Ebola drug diesThe virus can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick or from touching victims' bodies, leaving doctors and other health care workers most vulnerable to contracting it.Only six people in the world are known to have received ZMapp. The small supply is now said to be exhausted and it is expected to be months before more can be produced by its US maker.So why were two people who have been around Ebola patients brought to the CDC in Georgia?If mortality rate is 90% in Africa and under 50% in the first world won't some moron want to import them?You know who I mean.Regular readers respond strongly, and surprisingly positively, to two topics which feature fairly regularly in this column: Protestants and Jews. To be specific, the historical experience of Southern Protestants and European Jews.Eoghan Harris me me me farticle from last SundayThe largest number, nearly 80pc, live in France Their numbers are dropping fast, from 535,000 in 1980 to some 500,000 in just two decades, and that decrease is being accelerated by events like the Toulouse murder of a Rabbi and his three children.Seriously that is from the brainfart from the nag that Bertie Ahern won the money on in the 3:30 at Chepstow all those years ago.Now if this thicko and Brenadan O'Connor are Cork morons think of Tipperary where they have just celebrated the second anniversary of evryone finally being able to stand on thier hindlegs and Denise Charlatan wants to import TB or AIDS or Ebola sufferers with an average IQ of 67.

Tampa Tribune Pulls "Repugnant" Anti-Gay ColumnThe Tampa Tribune has pulled a controversial column that alleged Disney is indoctrinating children with its "pro-gay agenda."On August 11, Douglas MacKinnon, who is listed on the since-pulled column as "Tribune staff," argued that Disney has been engaged in an underhanded effort to wrongly "indoctrinate" children. He also contended the company is trying to subtly push an agenda through its children's programming.The piece, titled, "Disney's pro-gay agenda is disturbing," quoted an anonymous "former Disney executive" saying, "the company has taken direct aim at children to indoctrinate them about gay lifestyles and gay marriage through shows it airs on The Disney Channel and Disney XD."MacKinnon later added:The former executive said one of the more subtle techniques is to incorporate the colors of the gay-pride flag in as many shots as possible. The colors are woven in as a wink and nod to the gay community and show up on shirts, hats, posters, stacked cups and rings. The practice has been picked up by other children's networks and national advertisers. Disney also pushes the gay agenda by introducing openly gay characters and couples on its children's programing. Again, that is their right, but should they be in the business of entertaining children or indoctrinating them?http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/08/14/tampa-tribune-pulls-repugnant-anti-gay-column/200438Frank Galton

.Not strictly on-topic, but still ...http://hat4uk.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/breaking-chaos-beckons-in-france-as-hollande-orders-pm-valls-to-form-new-government/BREAKING…..CHAOS BECKONS IN FRANCE AS HOLLANDE ORDERS PM VALLS TO FORM NEW GOVERNMENTBy John Ward August 25, 2014 75% of new Italian debt short-term French Government falls Geman bunds go net negative Hollande fires rebels The Draghi Jackson Hole effect Manuel Valls…dans le merdeParis government split, Italian government broke: eurozone’s crisis now deeper than ever.Just five months after the last government resigned and he took office as Prime Minister, France’s Manuel Valls must now form a new government after two leftist Cabinet rebels, Montebourg and Hamon, flayed the country’s economic policy in general and Francois Hollande in particular.As predicted here and elsewhere, the Socialist Party is finding it increasingly difficult to carry out the austerity policy dictated to it by Brussels-am-Berlin. Hollande himself would not have adopted it had the US/EU axis not blatantly attacked his borrowing costs – as reported by The Slog earlier this year. The PS Left has been incandescent about the austerity policy since that time.Sources in Paris confirm that Montebourg and Hamon will be fired, damaging the fragile unity of the Socialists still further. It is also thought likely that Valls will appoint more close allies to the Cabinet. But none of this will solve the increasing radicalism of the syndicats (Unions) beyond the National Assembly.The right wing UMP Opposition was quick to take advantage of weekend criticisms of Hollande. “If Arnault Montebourg and Benoit Hamon had any dignity they would quit. If Manuel Valls and François Hollande had any authority, they would fire them,” centre-right UMP deputy Bruno Le Maire told Le Monde. “The problem is that never in the Fifth Republic have we had so little dignity and so little authority at the head of the state.”Well, Hollande has asserted his authority….but his left wing has predictably condemned the action as “too authoritarian”.This is a pivotal moment in both French and EU history. After the Jackson Hole speech from Draghi, it is now even clearer that the eurozone is flatlining, and Germany is the only real safe haven: immediately the markets opened today, German Bunds went net negative yield and currently stand at -0.04%.Two things, both predicted here, are now falling into place:With every day that passes, I think of Yeats.The Second ComingTurning and turning in the widening gyre The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity.... and so on.UN.

@Frank Galton:the kick the YKWs must get from defiling the memory and image of Disney, probably one the reasons they could nt wait to buy it, Walt Disney after all was a notorious "anti-Semite", in turning good clean family entertainment with a moral lesson into pro gay programming aimed at white Christian children.Walt pops up in South Park regularly as an evil mouse who behaves like a gangster boss.  During the episode "The Ring", his main motive with the Jonas Brothers was to "sell sex" to little girls with sex euphemisms to "stupid" Christian families. Of course who writes South Park?Of interest when Saddam Hussein was held captive by the Americans: the movie "South Park was shown to him repeatedly. In the film Hussein is shown as the Devils gay lover.

Violence mars Notting Hill Carnival carnival after 11 people are stabbed.Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan, said he is concerned by the growing number of stabbings, some of which were "centimetres from being a murder" as the two-day street festival in west London came to a close. The Met said they made 252 arrests over the weekend, including 76 for drug crimes, 43 for public order offences and 23 for possessing an offensive weapon. In response to the stabbings, the Met imposed Section 60 public order measures last night, giving officers powers to stop and search across the carnival from 7pm until 2am this morning. Nine people were stabbed during a violent clash at the corner of Colville Terrace and Colville Gardens and a 29-year-old man was rushed to hospital with serious stab wounds. He is said to be a in a stable condition, while eight others received knife wounds. Eight people were arrested in connection with the brutal fight. In two other knife attacks, an 18-year-old man was injured in Southam Street, and another 25-year-old man suffered a serious stab wound that is being treated as attempted murder.In response to the stabbings the Met imposed Section 60 public order measures, giving officers powers to stop and search.http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/503535/Violence-mars-Notting-Hill-Carnival-carnival-after-11-people-are-stabbed

Interestingly enough, my work takes me to the Auckland International Airport on a regular basis. Over the last week a good deal of the signage, departure/landing info, etc. has become bilingual ... English and Chinese.The "NO SPITTING" signs are of course bi-lingual. Chinese used to spit big gobs of mucus on the carpet, inside the airport terminal. Auckland airport is noted for its nice carpet. Not wanting to single anyone out, I guess they need to Chinesify all the signs so they can't be accused of calling the Chinese "spitters".At Sydney airport, they have bilingual signs too, also targeted in particular instances to the troublemakers of one particular race. At the arrivals area there is a red line and you are supposed to wait behind it to greet your relatives and friends, to prevent congestion at the customs area exit door. One section of Australian society however routinely defies this directive and constantly blocks the exit causing inconvenience to everyone else. That's why the sign on the floor is in Arabic as well as English. I've noticed that Arabs are pushy, loud, and obnoxious. They break the standard rules of Australian society all the time. This is just a tacit official acknowledgement of the fact.

I was sure Ken Loach was part-jew, but I cant be arsed to look right now. Of course, Mike Leigh (Lieberman is, and SIR David Puttnam. And of course, SIR Jeremy Issacs..cant have those goyim in charge of the Televitz Screens, oh, no:"In 2007, Loach was one of more than 100 artists and writers who signed an open letter initiated by Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism and the South West Asian, North African Bay Area Queers (SWANABAQ) and calling on the San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival "to honour calls for an international boycott of Israeli political and cultural institutions, by discontinuing Israeli consulate sponsorship of the LGBT film festival and not co-sponsoring events with the Israeli consulate." Loach also joined "54 international figures in the literary and cultural fields" in signing a letter that stated, in part, "celebrating 'Israel at 60' is tantamount to dancing on Palestinian graves to the haunting tune of lingering dispossession and multi-faceted injustice". The letter was published in the International Herald Tribune on 8 May 2008."Responding to a report, which he described as "a red herring", on the growth of antisemitism since the beginning of the Gaza War, he has said: "If there has been a rise I am not surprised. In fact, it is perfectly understandable because Israel feeds feelings of anti-Semitism." He added "no-one can condone violence".In May 2009, organisers of the Edinburgh International Film Festival returned a £300 grant from the Israeli Embassy after speaking with Ken Loach. The director was supporting a boycott of the festival called for by the PACBI campaign. In response, former Channel 4 chief executive Sir Jeremy Isaacs describing Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, he said: "They must not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming." Later, a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned £300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself would fund Israeli filmmaker Tali Shalom-Ezer's travel to Edinburgh out of its own budget. In an open letter to Ms Shalom Ezer, Ken Loach wrote "From the beginning, Israel and its supporters have attacked their critics as anti-semites or racists. It is a tactic to undermine rational debate. To be crystal clear: as a film maker you will receive a warm welcome in Edinburgh. You are not censored or rejected. The opposition was to the Festival’s taking money from the Israeli state". To his critics, he added later: "The boycott, as anyone who takes the trouble to investigate knows, is aimed at the Israeli state."Loach said he had a "respectful and reasoned" conversation with event organisers, saying they should not be accepting funds from Israel."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Loach

Im trying to resist the "I just saw this on telly" routine, but, just flicking through the channels:BBC4 "A History Of Britain By JEW Simon Schama":'The Wromg Empire"JEW Simon Schama traces the steps of the empire-makers, asking how a trading empire based on the idea of liberty became an empire built on SLAVERY"Slavery is baad, umkay. Well it is when White Europeans do it, umkay.My neighbour ( a supposed lesbian who keeps getting off with men-no, not my upstairs neighbour who is a fag-hag, and not my downstairs neighbours who are two fags)) today asked me if I wanted to watch a"great film" theyd got off netflicks.It was "12 Years A Slave"...I bluntly declined and started reciting some facts of which she was of course unaware (she's unaware of most things, to be fair, with the exception of how to get shitty £40 a gram "coke" at 2 am)Anyway, her eyes glazed over.Grizzom/Mamis Shit re-posted this today, I wish she'd watch it:The True World Masters of Slavery(David Duke vid)http://grizzom.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/the-true-world-masters-of-slavery.htmlLots of good stuff at Mamis today:http://grizzom.blogspot.co.uk/

This is interesting. From the website of Covington.http://downwithjugears.blogspot.co.nz/Sunday, August 24, 2014 Swiss Banks Hop On Yuan Bandwagon by Bill White Switzerland’s National Bank and the People’s Bank of China have reached an agreement to swap their respective currencies, meaning the trade between Swiss banking customers and China will no longer have to be mediated by banking systems depending on the Federal Reserve or European Central Bank (ECB).This agreement is that latest of nearly two dozen which China has made with central banks, including he ECB, the Bank of England, and the Australian Central Bank, which allow for trade between the nations to use China’s currency, the yuan. Before the agreements, someone with large amounts of national currency, like the Swiss franc, would have to route transactions through a bank in a third-party nation, or the People’s Bank of China itself, to obtain Yuan, or to exchange yuan for heir national currency. Now Swiss companies can exchange up to 150 billion yuan (21 billion Swiss francs) through the Swiss banking system.These agreements by China are part of a strategy to limit American world influence and help present an alternative to the U.S.-led Bretton Woods system. Before 2009, when China began this push, most currency transactions went through the Federal Reserve, with the International Monetary Fund providing loans to support national currencies. Among other things this meant the U.S., could isolate nations by denying them access to the Federal Reserve system to clear international transactions, a tactic recently used against Iran.Under China’s new regime, countries could continue trade the China, and theoretically with nations in China’s exchange network, even if access to the U.S. banking system was terminated.This news comes a week after China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa announced the launch of a new development bank and currency reserve designed to provide small nations with an alternative to the World Bank/IMF system. China has pledged to Venezuela this week $40 billion in loans and economic aid to shore up the Venezuelan economy, loans Venezuela is repaying with 100,000 barrels of oil worth about $9.3 million on the international market a day.In the past, the United States has been able to starve small nations like Venezuela or Argentina of dollars, and cause substantial harm to their economies. Such nations have had to import heavily dollar-denominated  contracts and have also, in the case of Argentina, exported dollars as interest payments on their bonds. Their domestic economies’ dollar-dependence has thus driven down exchange rates. A yuan alternative for such nations, back by a steady supply of yuan from China, would transfer nations’ economic dependence from the U.S. to China.Nations are only financially independent when they print their own currency, giving it value by accepting it for taxes and demanding its acceptance by foreigners. The alternative, which exists in most nations and the U.S., has a federal bank print currency only to fund loans, giving it value by accepting it as interest. The former system is debt free because the nation spends money into existence. The latter creates a never-ending debt cycle because money only comes into existence when it is lent. When too many debts come due, the system collapses—which is why never-ending inflation, which planners hope will expand the money supply faster than payment is demanding, characterizes modern economies.The first comment:- 1 Comment Anonymous said...So, they're basically doing what National Socialists did in 1933.

Here’s how some darkies are responding to the Ebola outbreak:http://www.tvcnews.tv/?q=article/nigerians-turn-jokes-ease-ebola-tensionThe outbreak has led some to take drastic action.Newspaper seller Mallam Hassan says he no longer allows his customers to read the papers at his newsstand unless they are wearing gloves."My customers, they came to me (and said) I should stop people touching my newspapers. I say, why? They said, because of Ebola. I should not allow my customers to touch my newspapers. I say, why? They said because there is Ebola spreading around. I say, why? They said because most of my customers, I don't know whether they're affected with Ebola," he said.Although the prospect of Ebola in Lagos, Africa's biggest city with 21 million people, has ratcheted up alarm about its spread, some remain sceptical."If they say the Ebola is real, I don't know, because me I am a typical African man, I don't believe, that's my own belief because the Bible let us understand that as man thinketh in his heart, so shall it be. With my own heart, I don't believe that maybe I am going to contract any Ebola disease," said Emmanuel Ogudubi.-----------------https://www.facebook.com/KGpages4/posts/746973682006058A Letter to Mr Ebola VirusDear Mr Ebola, You are the last thing we want in this country.We are still dealing with1.

(Lol… See as Naija take turn europe o)..Neighbors, even family members become suspects at the slightest sign of illness.. (the one wey make my neighbour go call health officers for me because say he see me sneeze 2 times today).You take a girl out for dinner, drives her back to her house, walk her to the door-step, she leaves you, walks to her door, open it, waves at you and throw a goodnight kiss at you (if you like catch am).The aboki that sells suya beside our house, dey chop Him suyas himself these days because even the suya is a suspect (Who wan die?)Nigeria Police don’t arrest People by Themselves anymore, if You commit any Crime just do the arresting by Yourself.

'Wake up white Australia': Anti-Semitic flyers distributed in SydneyCan't fault the sentiment, but i think even i might have produced a more legible offering.Are these type of flyers a help or  hindrance?

One can only conclude that the police are our enemy, an existential threat to our people.ALlan@AberdeenYou read reports saying that it's just the political leadership of the police that's hostile to the public.  When the fit hits the shan, they say, the police will side with us.  They know the score.This may be true in America. It's not true, I think, in Britain.A couple of years ago, during the riots in London, I went to a police blog to get their perspective.  They were clueless.  Anybody who pointed out who was actually rioting was soon deleted and banned (including me).  With, of course, the usual abuse from the gallery. True believers, all.

Analogman, sorry to say I agree with you against Allen@Aberdeen.  Maybe things are different up there but police down here seem to be as you describe. You see the understood requirements for career advancement seep into the pores of everyone in the organisation and they absorb this into their actual personality.Getting very philosophical but I think you know what I mean.

Holocaustralian.  Very interesting point you raise about that flyer. I was reading through it and nodding my head, yes this is good stuff.Then the sting in the tail.  Guilt by association.  Rightly or wrongly the association with Stormfront and anything Hitlerish is a killer. Hard to say whether it did more harm than good. At least it might get people thinking.But it does underline again the absolute disparity in resources between true patriots and our enemies.

jeremy, Analog - I wish that the lower ranks of the police were 'on our side' but my direct experience shows this not to be so. The recruits are filtered from the outset such that nobody liklely to side with us would get in. In Aberdeen, one of our (BNP at the time) activists was arrested for assault, though he was absolutely innocent. The police fromed him, lied in court and falsified their notes. That was the reality check for me.Allan@Aberdeen

Thanks Holocaustralian for that.Here's the exact text contained on the plain typed flyer shown at SBS (Looking at their site: a multiculti/race tax payer funded anti-White broadcaster).---------------The Jews own all Hollywood studios & 97% of US newspapers and media. Any movie or tv show you watch may as well be coming straight from Israel.They pump anti European values, race mixing, drug abuse everything that is harmful to our young people and they wouldn't have it any other way.Jews have been kicked out of countries 109 times through history.Is this anti semetism???Predjuce of the times???Or is there something more sinister???Could it be that having them in a European country is harmful to the host????Wake up white AustraliaFor people with an open mind, youtube search Dr. William Pierce - the history of everything and Dr William Pierce national health.Let's take a stand join Squadron 88 email squadron88sydney@gmail.com find us on facebook or on Stormfront.org in the downunder section-------------These people should be congratulated for at least doing something. The actual content is very factual and there is nothing hateful in it. I would suggest that they:* Get someone to proofread their text as the above has spelling and grammar issues. * Get someone with some graphic design to make it attractive.* Have some introductory material explaining what they are about.* Provide links to good sites and info.--------My latest blog post is here: KATANA

Richard Bacon on BBC5live is tip-toeing sickenly in his pre-amble to a "discussion " on the MUZ SCUM rapists.The men are..of an "Asian Background" (MUZ SCUM)..which is "a sensitive issue" (WHY?)and Richard fears that there may be lurking some "awful ,old-fashioned attitudes" (WAYCISSUM) in the minds of the "older White men" who should have investigated/prosecuted.The guest ,Richard Marshall..an "independent clinical psychologist" agrees, saying that such)older White Men) men inevitably hold "misogynist attitudes" WHAT THESE FUCKERS darent say: WHY ARE THESE PAKI MUZ BASTARD CRIMINALS HERE AND WHY ARE THE POLICE (AND US) LETTING THEM RAPE OUR WHITE GIRLS?
