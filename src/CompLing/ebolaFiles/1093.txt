The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa an international public health emergency. Ebola Declared Public Health Emergency. With that being said, there may be hope in terms of a possible treatment. 
ZMapp, being developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., is an experimental treatment, for use with individuals infected with Ebola virus. ZMapp is the result of a collaboration between Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, LeafBio, Defyrus Inc., the US government and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).
ZMapp is a combination of three different “humanized” monoclonal antibodies manufactured in plants, specifically Nicotiana, that bind to the protein of the Ebola virus. The monoclonal antibodies bind to the virus so the human immune system can clear the virus.
ZMapp is not a vaccine so is not a way to prevent the Ebola virus infection.
The product is still in an experimental stage. Zmapp has not gone through clinical trials, meaning its safety and effectiveness has not yet been tested in humans.
At this point, Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc has stated it has exhausted its supply of Zmapp after shipping doses to Africa to treat two Liberian doctors. Even though Zmapp has not been approved as a treatment, it has been deemed ethical for use during this Ebola Outbreak.
