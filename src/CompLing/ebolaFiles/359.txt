The World Health Organization reported 52 deaths between in three days..


The death toll from the largest outbreak of Ebola in history increased to 1,013 after 52 more people died between August 7 and 9 in three countries of West Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported Monday. 
The largest number of deaths was reported in Liberia, where 29 people died, while there were 17 deaths in Sierra Leone and six in Guinea, the WHO said in its website. 
The outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in West Africa continues to evolve in alarming ways, while no apparent solution or end to the epidemic crisis is in sight, the WHO admitted.
The most severely affected countries, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, have only recently returned to political stability following years of civil war and conflict, which left health systems largely destroyed or severely disabled.
