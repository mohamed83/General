Local residents gather around a very sick Saah Exco, 10, in a West Point slum back alley in Monrovia, Liberia, on Aug. 19, 2014. According to community organizer John Saah Mbayoh, Saah's mother died of suspected but untested Ebola virus in West Point before he was brought to the isolation center on the evening of Aug. 13.

Local residents discuss how to help Saah Exco in an alley of the West Point slum on Aug. 19. Saah came with his brother, Tamba, 6, aunt Ma Hawa, and cousins, but his brother died on Friday at the isolation center. Saah fled the facility that night with several other patients before it was overrun on Saturday afternoon by looters, who stole blood-stained sheets and mattresses.
