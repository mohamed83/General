Tell world leaders to act now on Ebola





More than 4,000 men, women and children have died from Ebola and the number is likely to get much worse. Families travel for miles and end up sitting outside overwhelmed clinics, waiting to die, because there is no room inside. This is wrong
This disease can be stopped. We know what to do. Personnel, materials and international coordination are urgently needed. And the UN estimates that donors need to step up with $1 billion, and that could rise. So we've got to act faster, and do more right now.
We need our leaders to do more than just talk about this epidemic. We need them to act NOW. We don't have a day to waste.  
Add your name and urge world leaders to step up and act on Ebola now.


Dear
             
             World Leaders, 


We're counting on you to quickly make bold commitments and help end the Ebola epidemic now.
