HOW TO AVOID BEING MISTAKENLY QUARANTINED FOR EBOLA







So, despite the prayers of all our men of god and prayer warriors,
Ebola somehow found its way into Nigeria. It is not my place to judge the
efficacy of prayers or if the men of god should review their status as people
with access to heaven. I mean with all the 10% gate fees these men of god
collect, we should expect more, but I am more concerned about earthly issues.

For example, the
Federal Government has announced that it will start checking the body
temperature of people coming on certain flights into the country. Why are they
checking for high temperatures? Because a fever is one of the early symptoms of
Ebola. Other symptoms of Ebola include, weakness, sore throat, headache,
diarrhea, rashes, red eyes, vomiting, hiccups, internal and external bleeding and
muscle aches. (To be clear, if you experience any combination of these
symptoms you should immediately go to a hospital. Ebola patients who survive
usually get early treatment.)

This article is
about how a healthy person avoids being mistaken for an Ebola patient and have
his or her hustle truncated for a long time. Because the moment for example, your
temperature is detected as being high, you will be immediately quarantined and
observed/tested for Ebola. And you know Nigerians. Even if it turns out to be a
wrong call and it was your laptop that created the heat and you are allowed to
go after a few days, Nigerians will avoid you for the next three months.
Neighbours will ban their children from going to your house.  The church
committee you are on will suddenly start having meetings behind your back. Your
wife may suddenly decide to go and visit her cousin for a while. Your
relatives, in anticipation of your eventual demise will begin quarreling over
your property as if you didn’t exist.

Yes, fear of Ebola
is understandable and even expected, but we are the lords of stigma and will
judge you for even being suspected of Ebola.

If you ever thought
that anyone cares about you in Nigeria, stop it. Now! We are not America that
flies one citizen alone on a plane from Liberia to receive the best care at
home. You must take matters into your own hands to avoid all the things that
can raise your temperature or make you a suspect at an airport.

1.      Do not sleep on the plane. Getting off the plane
looking groggy or red-eyed can lead to profiling. A health officer from the
Ebola team will pull you aside for questioning and with social media, within
two minutes your family and entire community will hear on Facebook and Twitter
that you are being tested for Ebola. Even if all the health officer did was ask
you one question before letting you go.

2.      Do not take too much alcohol before flying or landing.
This gives off at least two symptoms of Ebola: red eyes, and weakness.

3.   Do not be a glutton and eat everything
offered on the plane. You do not know what you will go and eat or drink that
will make your stomach run. And in these days of Ebola, once Nigerians see you
go to the toilet many times, they will be the first to tell airport officials
that you seemed to have diarrhea on the plane and they suspect you have Ebola.
Eat only what you know please. And drink only water. You can eat well when you
get home.

4.      Do not slouch or walk sluggishly as you leave the
plane. Walk upright. March if you have to. Sing songs. Show signs of strength
and vitality. Anything that will make them not suspect you have Ebola.

Now, one
consequence of the Ebola scare is that you may become paranoid and suspect every
passerby of having the virus. Sometimes extreme worry can stress you out which
can in turn reduce your immunity and make you have headaches and all. Then you
start really freaking out and go to the hospital because of the headaches which
you think might be Ebola. Even though the doctor will tell you it is only
stress, people will hear that you freaked out and went to check if you had
Ebola, and then the stigma will begin. That kind of stigma takes months if not
years to disappear.

So, how do you put
your mind at ease about being exposed to the virus? I do not suggest that you
stop touching people altogether, but if you are that kind of thorough person
who hates loose ends, here are ways to politely avoid touching people in public:

1.      If you are a northern woman this is easy. Just say you
do not shake hands with men. When you meet women tie your veil in such a manner
that your hands are hidden from view. Make exaggerated gestures with your head
to distract them. Say hello but quickly add that you are in a hurry.

2.      If you have nail polish, use it often. Always tell
people you want your nail polish to dry. If there is anything we respect in
this country, it is the right of nail polish to dry undisturbed.

3.      Tie a bandage around your hand before you go out and
tell people you have a fracture. They will not attempt to shake you and will
even feel sympathy for you. In fact some will go as far as invoke the healing power of da lord  to cure you. This one has a downside: as the overzealous person is trying to pray for you, he or she may end up trying to touch you, lay hands on you. Quickly inform them that your own man of god has it covered and you don't want to fuck up that prior prayer. Walk away quickly. 

4.      For people who are stubborn, pick your nose
exaggeratedly just before they want to take your hand. No one wants to shake
someone who has just finished digging into their nose.



May fear of the
virus not find us and permanently truncate our hustle.

You wan know who I be?

Elnathan is a writer and lawyer living in Nigeria. Although he is routinely called a journalist, he rejects this title, preferring instead to be called a writer. His works have appeared in ZAM Magazine, Per Contra, Evergreen Review and the Caine Prize for African Writing anthology 2013. He writes weekly for Sunday Trust(and any other publication that PAYS him). Except you are The New Yorker, he considers it violence of unimaginable proportions to ask him to write for free. He has never won anything. This record was almost disrupted by the Caine Prize when they accidentally allowed his story on the shortlist in 2013. Of course, he did not win. In 2008, after being lied to by friends and admirers about the quality of his work, he hastily self-published an embarrassing collection of short stories which has thankfully gone out of print. He hopes to never repeat that foolish mistake.He has just completed work on a new collection of short stories and a novel. Nobody seems to want to publish his collection of short stories. This puzzles him. He really loves those stories.
Elnathan is touchy about his skin and man boobs and isn't bold enough to grow hair. One of his new goals is getting to a weight below his current 100+kg and losing his fast growing beer belly. He hopes to start a family comprising a partner, no kids and two hairy pets. He lives on Twitter.
