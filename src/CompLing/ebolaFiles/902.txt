Washington/Berlin (dpa) - The International Monetary Fund on
Friday approved 130 million dollars in emergency financial aid to
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to fight the Ebola outbreak that has
now claimed more than 3,000 lives.The World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday that the death toll
in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had risen to 3,083 and that the
total number of cases stood at 6,553.The IMF's executive board said it would immediately make available 41
million dollars for Guinea, 49 million dollars for Liberia and 40
million dollars for Sierra Leone."The IMF is working hard with the authorities of the affected
countries and their development partners to ensure that the outbreak
is quickly brought under control and to assist the economic
rebuilding effort that must follow," Managing Director Christine
Lagarde said.A major international aid effort is under way for West African
nations hit hard by the epidemic with some 300 million dollars in
additional support pledged on the sidelines of the United Nations
General Assembly Thursday.WHO earlier this month called for a 600-million-dollar international
response to fight the scourge. The World Bank has said it would
mobilize 230 million dollars for the three hardest-hit countries.US President Barack Obama, speaking at a health forum in Washington,
said the global community must "keep up this momentum.""This epidemic underscores - vividly and tragically - what we already
knew, which is, in a world as interconnected as ours, outbreaks
anywhere, even in the most remote villages and the remote corners of
the world, have the potential to impact everybody, every nation," he
said.Meanwhile, Germany's first volunteers in the fight against the Ebola
virus are due to hit the ground in affected regions of West Africa by
mid- to late October, a military spokesman said."We will presumably have them on the ground in four weeks," a
spokesman for the German military's medical service told dpa.The German Defence Ministry said around 4,500 soldiers and civilians,
including doctors, technicians and logistics experts, have emailed or
called to help with containment efforts in the region.The amount of time it takes to prepare the volunteers may delay an
October deployment, a ministry spokeswoman said.Cuba is also stepping up efforts to fight the virus, with local media
reporting that the island nation is preparing to send more than 400
medical workers to affected African nations.A total of 461 medical staff are being trained to help fight the
Ebola outbreak, the Prensa Latina agency reported, more than double
the 165 experts announced two weeks ago by Raul Castro's government.Out of several experimental-stage drugs and vaccines being developed,
the WHO said Friday it was now focusing on two Ebola vaccines and one
kind of drug therapy for use in West Africa.The results of clinical trials of the vaccines, named chimpanzee
adenovirus and VSV, were expected by the end of December, and usage
could start early next year, senior WHO official Marie-Paule Kieny
said.The two drugs are being developed by British company GlaxoSmithKline
and US-based NewLink Genetics, respectively.WHO has said that health workers and other field staff will be the
first to receive immunization, and Kieny stressed that not enough
vaccines would be available for mass immunization campaigns.Efforts to use experimental Ebola drugs are focused on therapies that
use blood from survivors of the virus, according to Kieny.So-called convalescent serum, a component of blood taken from
survivors, contains antibodies that the body produces to survive a
virus.Such therapies have not reached the clinical trial stage, but the
therapy was successfully used in 1995 to treat a small number of
Ebola patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo.An infected US doctor who had been working in Liberia was declared
free of the Ebola virus Thursday after receiving a blood transfusion
from a survivor of the virus.

FEATURE Too few beds, too many Ebola patients at Liberian hospitalsOnly one out of six Ebola patients in Liberia have access to a
treatment facility. The rest are ill at home. More than six months
after the epidemic broke out in West Africa, aid is finally starting
to pour in. But for many, help will come too late.
