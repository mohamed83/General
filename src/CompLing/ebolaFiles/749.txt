Maybe We Don’t Understand Religion But Did TB Joshua Just Say This About Ebola?
Posted by Three Men On a Boat on  August 18th, 2014 

Nigerian church leader TB Joshua has made some interesting statements about the ebola virus.
He says, wait for it… wait he is said to have said… oh heck, we will just put it out there:
The so called strange ailment coming from three nations – Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia… satan is the manufacturer, the source. Begin to capture the covenant of that strange sickness. Command that strange ailment to come out and go to the pit of hell, in the name of Jesus Christ!
He sent 4,000 bottles of ‘anointing water’ to Sierra Leone the other day plus a cool $50,000 in aid.
So, erm, does this mean since Satan… we’re confused.
But then again, we are not really that religious are we?
