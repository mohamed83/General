Submitted by Tyler Durden on  08/12/2014 08:38 -0400

















 
Sadly, the Spanish missionary priest who became infected with Ebola treating patients in Liberia has died in hospital in Madrid. As AP reports, Father Miguel Pajares died despite receiving the experimental drug ZMapp, and is one of 3 patients to receive it (the American doctors in Atlanta being the other 2). This morning the WHO confirmed the use of "experimental, unproven" Ebola drugs such as ZMapp was ethical in this situation, as the death toll tops 1000 in what WHO called the "most severe and most complex outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history." Perhaps most concerning of all this morning is news that China is quarantining 8 of its West African nurses (as the death toll among health workers surges).
 
As AP reports,






A Spanish missionary priest being treated for Ebola died Tuesday in a Madrid hospital, authorities said.
 

 
Spain's Health Ministry said a day earlier that it had obtained a course of the U.S.-made experimental Ebola drug ZMapp to treat Father Miguel Pajares, 75.
 
Pajares died Tuesday at Carlos III Hospital, the hospital and his order said. The hospital would not confirm that he had been treated with the drug, but his order said earlier that he would be.
 
He is one of only three Ebola patients thought to have received the experimental drug. The others are two Americans evacuated to Atlanta.
 
Pajares, who was treating people with Ebola at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital in Liberia when he became infected, was evacuated to Spain on Thursday. He worked for the San Juan de Dios hospital order, a Spain-based Catholic humanitarian group that runs hospitals around the world.

*  *  *
The World Health Organization confirms use of experimental and unproven Ebola drugs is ethical:

*WHO PANEL SAYS ETHICAL TO USE UNPROVEN EBOLA DRUGS
*WHO: LOOKING AT 3 TYPES OF PRODUCTS TO TREAT EBOLA
*WHO: HOPE THERE ARE MORE ZMAPP DOSES BY END OF YEAR
*WHO: WE DON'T MAKE ANY CHOICES ON WHO GETS EBOLA DRUGS
*WHO: IT'S A MARKET FAILURE THAT NO DRUG APPROVED FOR EBOLA
*WHO: APPEARS THAT ZMAPP HAD `DRAMATIC' EFFECT ON 2 AMERICANS (but not on the Spanish priest)
*WHO: DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER ZMAPP WORKS
*WHO: IMPORTANT NOT TO GIVE FALSE HOPE ABOUT EBOLA DRUGS

An ethics panel ruled that the drugs, which have not yet passed clinical trials but have shown early promise in combating the virus, could provide a “potent asset” in the battle to contain the epidemic, which it called the “most severe and most complex outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history.”
*  *  *
Perhaps even more concerning is China's quarantining its West African nurses (as the death toll among health workers surges):






Eight Chinese medical workers who treated patients with Ebola have been placed in quarantine in Sierra Leone, Beijing's ambassador said Monday, but would not be drawn on whether they were displaying symptoms of the disease.
In addition, 24 nurses have been quarantined, health officials said, while a senior physician had contracted Ebola but was responding well to treatment.
The nation's sole virologist, who was at the forefront of its battle against the epidemic, died from Ebola last month.
As countries around the world were on alert, Japan said it was evacuating two dozen staff from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Does anyone really believe the government authorities about 'containment' of this plague?  I believe we are seeing the beginning of a multi-year outbreak that will kill tens of millions - mostly in Africa.  How's that Zmapp working on the two in Atlanta?

Exactly.
As alarming as the possibility of this extending to other countries, the death toll in Africa promises to be staggering.
It also is certain that there are those poised to profit from the carnage.

While Ebola is very contagious, it is not spread by droplet or air, it has to be human contact,” Bachman said. “We are absolutely confident that our policies, our procedures, our structure, our containment unit are such that the virus will not get out into the rest of the hospital or anywhere else.”
So what if it is airborne? And this guy is in charge with no contingency plans

It is worrisome that all those protected health care workers contracted the disease.
Plan A: The best plan.  Don't get around Ebola.
Plan B: The second best plan.  If you have to be around Ebola, be super protected and be super vigilant.
Plan C: The Oh Shit! contingency.  If you get infected with Ebola, get the drug.
(there is no plan D or E).
Plan F: This is the dealing with abject failure.   1) Lay down and die.  2) Give it to others.

Because they aren't using respirators and the virus obviously isn't airborne.  Duh.

They are not covered in "100% body hazemat suits".  That's why.
Also, I know of two cases where transmission was entirely possible and happened:
1- A stupid patient was urinating on hospital staff.
2- A nurse touched a particular object (without gloves) shortly after a sick patient did.
 
The 100% hazemat suits will be found on those treating the patient in the US, but they are not in africa.

EXACTLY! The bush nurses and doctors show up in loin cloth and sandals to treat Ebola. The Ebola patients were sent to the shaman and vodoo priest first.
Ebola will be eradicated in West Africa when the people there start shitting in porcelain.

CDC updated their Ebola fact page on Aug 7.   Looks like the concept of personal space is more than just a psychological comfort zone.
Casual contact is defined as a) being within approximately 3 feet (1  meter) or within the room or care area for a prolonged period of time  (e.g., healthcare personnel, household members) while not wearing  recommended personal protective equipment (i.e., droplet and contact  precautions–see Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations); or b)  having direct brief contact (e.g., shaking hands) with an EVD case  while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment (i.e.,  droplet and contact precautions–see Infection Prevention and Control  Recommendations). At this time, brief interactions, such as walking by a  person or moving through a hospital, do not constitute casual contact.

So things like being in a restaraunt / bar (prolonged contact), taxicab (already proven infection vector in Liberia) or an elevator, subway, anywhere recirculating / recycling air (planes, office buildings, night clubs, etc)
Put this under things to avoid.

The CDC says it is only airborne within a meter.  With no fans or recirculating air temperature control system.

Casual contact for the flu as defined by CDC is 6 feet, compared to ebola's 3 feet.

So on the bus, an infected individual might only infect two or three people instead of six or eight.

Basic physics and the flaws of human nature are adequate to explain why health workers are getting infected:
They're NOT wearing Ebola (Space) suits, and they're NOT following decontamination procedure (showers with suits on and then with suits off, etc,  etc).
There's NO way they're doing that.  Rather, they are all using improvised methods that are simply inadequate.

ZMapp Scorecard: W-2, L-1
Zmapp probably doesn't work, a drug based more on hope (or the synthetic drug favored by Obummer followers, hopium) than science.  You notice the almost total silence from big drug companies like Pfizer, GSK and Sanofi-Aventis on any drugs these companies have in the pipeline to treat a disease like Ebola hemmorhagic fever?  U.S. drug companies are more interested in inversions than cures these days.

If I had to guess it's more likely that the strain of just a few days of the violent symptoms was too much for a 75 year old.  There is no telling if the drug works or not yet.  That's what really makes you wonder if this is a planned or unwasted opportunity, old people will take the brunt of the deaths, social security problem solved.

It was probably too late. For the animal trials for Tekmira's solution, it was 100% effective if administered the day the animal was exposed to the virus, but down to something like 85% on day two, if I recall correctly.
You would need to be treated at time of infection, which is days or even a couple weeks before any symptoms show up.

These Christian missionaries are NUTS, flat out NUTS, the churches have been infected with liberalism, worship "People of Color and pay for your sins" propaganda and boy does it take hold. And it is NOT what Jesus taught, somehow Christianity got changed into Social Justice and all that. And worship of the Jewish people for Evangelicals. Just INSANE.
Note that these White Christians ever anxious to help Haiti, Africa, Central and South America and Asia, like Mother Theresa, NEVER help Whites, doesn't compute. Jesus was shall we say a bit not P-C but who really READS what he said.

Good, on one hand I suspect ZH readers are susceptible, on the other hand moving to the other side of awareness helps.  I have three pipsqueaks in my charge plus my lovely wife.  My neighbor was over last night to try one of my spareribs for a cookoff we are entering in the neighborhood next month and he was carrying on about how screwed up the world is (referring to ISIS) and he mentioned an email exchange with another neighbor from our poker group. Both of these guys have said they have had a bunch of days in a row where they read something which ruined their day.
 
 The other neighbor said that if he's right about  the worlds escalating violence and I'm right about the financial situation then things are going downhill fast. I then said, do you know about peak oil?  He said huh, what's that. I sent him some resources on the topic as well as the monetary system with the warning that these could ruin his day for several weeks.  He's got two kids under 3.  Sorry for the rambling.  Thanks for your comments Irridium, I'm following them.
 
Peace!

Ive been to the distillery. They have a natural spring that they use as their water source.
Do they do any fracking in TN?
http://ecowatch.com/2013/06/10/industry-targets-tn-state-passes-fracking...
 
The distillery is a mere 90 miles from Chattanooga, which lies close to the center of the width of Chattanooga shale field, placing all those mystery fracking chemicals some 45 miles from the Jack Daniels Distillery natural spring.

So did Robin Williams.
Don't do it.....
 
Why not? It is rather tempting at times. Especially when this fucking Ibuprofen does not take the edge off of the pain.
 
(And I will not go to a Doctor to become dependent on their narcotics. I have been there and they want to play a Power Trip with you.)
 
Living to suffer only to end it with a horrid death from Ebola...or Fuckyoushima...or World War III or Social Collapse staring you in the face?
 
It is rather inviting.  You already know the outcome of this Perfect Storm of disaster headed in your direction. There are no solutions as this is a predicament...not a problem.
 
It is pretty fucked up. It is not just one crisis but a cascade of them. It is like the "Perfect Storm" all developing coincidentally.
 
Any one of these would be concerning enough but to have all of them forming at the same time is guaranteed to overwhelm us.
 
There is no escape from the Mathematics of it. No matter how much you wish the ground away as you fall from the cliff the Physics of the situation will provide for that sudden fatal stop at the end.
 
I do not bet on infinitesimal odds. Oh there are miracles, but, I do not count on them.
 
Oh I will be here tomorrow. And the next day. And the next...I am not going anywhere...not yet. But I have the Insulin ready.
 
But who am I to tell someone else not to do it? I am not in their shoes. I am not experiencing their pain.
 
I really cannot blame them. The saddest part is that I actually can understand.
 
So why not?
 
There is no fucking hope.
 
If there is no hope then why suffer needlessly?

Things are adding up towards the perfect storm you speak of, particularly if one listens to GuyMcpherson.  However, these events are only what I am aware of, I have been fortunate to not experience the pain of any of this yet.  Who is to say what will happen when things hit home.  I've never been a hang it up type of person but then life has been pretty good.

I've made a killing and plan on taking the profits to complete the doomsday solar generator. 
 
Edit: They are getting hammered today by "traders" so it's a good day to buy. It will go back up. TKMR has a drug that was almost ready for human testing and CONX has a joint NIH deal for rapid Ebola test.

You have difficulty understanding the concept of experimental?
You don't produce large quanties of experimental drugs because ...DUH! They're experimental.
Now you have medical specialists who can save lives or a truck driver who eats monkey meat. Who gets the few doses made?
Not a hard choice to me.
Fuck the "White Privileged" crowd anyway. They're useless lefty whiners.
I don't see any bushman witch doctors creating a cure for Ebola so , sorry to say, the line forms at the rear.

Vice did a great documentary on Liberian bushmeat.  It is on youtube.
But seriously, so much what you said.  Hell, I'm white and I don't expect a Hercules air transport to be dropping me any Zmapp.  I'm looking out for myself and hoping that probability is on my side.  
People shouldn't pull the "blame whitey" card for how and who this drug gets distributed to.  Just in the same way white people/other people shouldn't be playing the "blame uneducated cannibal, monkey/fruitbat/groundhog diseased meat eating dipshits card" for who this disease gets distributed to.

The US government has confirmed that it will send doses of an experimental Ebola drug to treat doctors in Liberia. The treatment has been so far used on just three people, however, there is no vaccine for the virus.
US President Barack Obama and the Food and Drug Administration approved the request Monday to send the experimental drugs to Liberia, the West African nation's government said in a statement.
Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, which makes the drug ZMapp, released a statement on their website that said, "In responding to the request received this weekend from a West African nation, the available supply of ZMapp is exhausted."
"Any decision to use ZMapp must be made by the patients' medical team," it said, adding that the drug was "provided at no cost in all cases."
It remains unclear, however, how much of the treatment would be sent.

Some quarantines are better than others. If you take 8 nurses and quarantine them in the same place, without separating them, they will all get Ebola or they will all not get Ebola. I have my suspicions that normal quarantine is not enough for Ebola.
Ebola IS airborne.
Africa is a hot place. Will Ebola do as well in America's cooler places? Does temperature have anything to do with spread? We don't know.

Yup, and it seems the only question to sift out those with ebola from those with flu is: "Have you been in West Africa in the last 21 days?"
Once it begins to crop up in other countries, and domestically, it will be "Have you been anywhere in the last 21 days?" Not too helpful. Are we going to isolate everyone with flu symptoms, quarantine all their contacts?

a treatment with intravenous vitamin c can stop the hemorrhage thus, the  death toll ....

If this thing is as easy to transmit as some claim then it should sweep through Lagos Nigeria and wipe out a huge % of the population.  Watch for what happens there and then you will know the truth about this virus.  If it does kill millions in Lagos then prepare to isolate yourself no matter where you live.

21 million people are living in Lagos. If or when the epidemic gets underway many will flee the city to the countryside where they came from. In a short while, the whole of Nigeria will be infected. The same is going to happen in other countries.

i have no idea what part of this ebola thing is fear mongering, but just in case, mark these words :
 
mega dose of liposomal vitamin c
 
(the liposome helps our liver processing the mega dose as it treats it as fat -no limit while the liver cannot much process much vit c molecule every day, the excedent is directly evacuated)
 
it may not prevent catching it, but it 'll surely prevent dying from it
 
(i know i know what you'll think if it were working they'd be using it because big pharma only objective is our health... except that big pharma cannot patent vitamins, therefore any treatment based on vitamins is killing their profit; so why heal for cheap when you can search for expensive & profitable alternative eh ?)

When taken with a dose of 100mg of resveritrol, the useful consumption of vitamin c is increased 100-fold.  In other words - take vitamin c with your red wine.







Tue, 08/12/2014 - 14:04 | 5082760

unfortunately, nowadays, red wine contains very very little resveratrol if none at all (unless you buy from a local french/italian producer that does it the ancient way without any chemical anywhere in the process).

 "but it 'll surely prevent dying from it"
This statement right here is all I need from you to know that everything you are saying is bullshit.
FUCK OFF, PLEASE. Hate to be rude...
edit: or FUCK OFF AND TAKE LIPOSOMAL VITAMIN C IN THE HOPES THAT YOU SURELY WON'T DIE FROM IT.
