Training of Ebola outreach interns started





23 Sep 2014
After a 3 day ‘stay at home’ in Sierra Leone which prohibited the country’s 6 million residents from leaving their homes - in attempt to contain the virus - training of Restless Development Ebola outreach interns finally began.
200 young volunteers will be trained on the facts about Ebola, safety and security procedures, how to effectively communicate life-saving messages and how to monitor the quality of our work.
They will then be deployed in chiefdoms in 4 districts across the country, reaching 360,000 people.With your support we could reach even more districts and people.
Please show your solidarity with our young leaders by donating here.
