FREETOWN

Sierra Leone has threatened to review its relationship with Kenya and several other African countries over isolation following the Ebola outbreak.

Presidential Adviser Ibrahim Ben Kargbo said the country is angered by countries like Kenya, South Africa and Senegal whose actions suggest countries affected by Ebola were "pariah states".

National carrier Kenya Airways has suspended its flights to some Liberia and Sierra Leone following the Ebola outbreak.

Mr Kargbo, who heads the media arm of the Presidential Taskforce on Ebola, said he was surprised by the decision by

South Africa to ban travellers from Sierra Leon to enter the country.

Abandoned

He hit out at Senegal for "almost refusing" a Freetown-bound UN plane from passing through Dakar.

"It gives the impression that we are pariah states, which is not the case," he told state broadcaster, SLBC, and stressed that the Ebola epidemic was not a crime.

Other officials also called for a review of international relations with countries that have isolated Sierra Leone when the outbreak is contained.

Earlier this week, parliamentary Majority Leader Ibrahim Bundu, vowed that Sierra Leone will review its relations with those countries which abandoned it at a "time of greatest need".

Parliament is due to convene a special session to know which country or foreign development partner was staying by Sierra Leone, and then establish a "permanent record" of "our true friends".

Several African countries have slammed travel ban on citizens of the countries affected by the disease which has claimed over 1000 lives in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.

There have been news of Sierra Leoneans stranded in foreign airports and hundreds are unable to travel from the country due to cancellation of flights.

The travel ban has been blamed for increased economic difficulties, including food shortage and skyrocketing of prices of commodities in the country.
