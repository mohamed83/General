In an advice sent to the sex workers in the largest red-light area in Kolkata, it has been said that the sex workers need to be careful while choosing about choosing their customers from Africa, who are regular visitors to the place.  Durbar Mahila Samannay Committee â the NGO that works with nearly 13,000 sex workers of the area are closely monitoring the situation and are training the girls so that they can understand the symptoms, problems and threat of this disease. "We have requested the sex workers not to entertain people from African nations as it can be a life risk for them if they get infected by the highly contagious Ebola virus which is causing havoc in some West African countries," a member of DMSC said.  Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly designated Zaire ebolavirus) is the sole member of the Zaire ebolavirus species, and the most dangerous of the five known viruses within the genus Ebolavirus. Four of the five known ebolaviruses cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates, known as Ebola virus disease. "Though the disease yet to reach Kolkata but this is an easy way through which the disease be spread and so we are taking all steps to check all measures so that it can be checked before it arrives," the member said. Samarjit Jana of DMSC is presently engaged in training and providing lessons to sex workers to identify the signs of the Ebola disease.  According to WHO guidelines, transmission of the virus requires close contact with body fluids such as sweat, saliva and the cough of an infected person, and also body contact. "So we are training the sex workers on how to identify the symptoms," the member said. Article continuesStay updated on the go with The Times of India’s mobile apps.
