President Goodluck Jonathan on Wednesday condemned the stigmatisation of Nigerians by some countries over recent cases of Ebola virus in the country.

Jonathan made this known at a meeting with Dr David Navarro, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Ebola, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.

This is contained in a statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Dr Reuben Abati.

The president, according to the statement, decried discriminatory actions by some countries against Nigeria, including the incident which forced Nigeria’s team to the Youth Olympics in China to abandon its participation.

He said there was no justification for such stigmatisation of Nigerians since the Ebola Virus had been effectively contained in the country and never attained epidemic level.

He called for the immediate cessation of every discriminatory action against Nigerians around the world over the virus and urged the UN Secretary General, Mr Ban Ki-Moon, to support the call.
