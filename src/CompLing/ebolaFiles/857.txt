Ebola Threatens West Africa Food Supply Amid Restrictions

West Africa’s Ebola outbreak has
caused trade disruptions that are making food more expensive as
labor shortages put upcoming harvests at risk, the UN’s Food &
Agriculture Organization said. 
Movement controls and quarantine zones created to stop the
disease from spreading have curbed transport and sale of food,
resulting in panic buying and “significant” price jumps for
some commodities, the United Nations agency wrote in a report
dated today on its website. 
Ebola spread to a fifth country last month, with a Guinean
man testing positive for the virus in Senegal. It has sickened
3,069 people and killed 1,552, according to figures from the
World Health Organization updated last week. 
“With the main harvest now at risk and trade and movements
of good severely restricted, food insecurity is poised to
intensify in the weeks and months to come,” Bukar Tijani, the
FAO’s regional representative for Africa, was cited as saying in
the statement. 
The main harvest season for rice and corn is “only weeks”
away, and labor shortages on farms due to movement restrictions
and migration to other areas will “seriously” impact
production, the FAO said. 
Generally adequate rains during the 2014 season had led to
expectations for favorable harvests in the main Ebola-affected
countries, FAO said. Areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia that are
most affected by Ebola are also among the most productive, and
food output is now expected to be seriously reduced, it wrote. 
Crops Affected 
Cash crops such as palm oil, cocoa and rubber are also
expected to be “seriously” affected, according to the report.
The livelihood and food purchasing power of many families
depends on production of the commodities, the FAO said. 
In Monrovia, Liberia, the prices of some food items have
surged, with the price of cassava jumping 150 percent in the
first weeks of August, the FAO wrote. 
The price spikes have put food out of reach for some
households in the affected area, which may have social
repurcussions that could have a subsequent impact on disease
containment, the FAO said. 
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are all net grain
importers, according to the FAO. The closing of some border
crossings as well as reduced trade from seaports are causing
tighter supply and “sharply” increasing food prices, it said. 
Virus Spreads 
The Ebola virus is spread through direct contact with
bodily fluids from an infected person. The disease causes fever,
diarrhea, muscle pain and vomiting, and as it progresses can
lead to bleeding from the eyes, ears and nose. 
The outbreak began in Guinea, spread to neighboring Sierra
Leone and Liberia and also has appeared in Nigeria, the
continent’s most populous country. Senegal closed its border
with Guinea last month to contain Ebola, slowing trade between
the two countries. Six people have died in Nigeria, where the
first case was a Liberian man who flew into Lagos, the country’s
largest city. 
The World Food Programme has started a regional emergency
operation to bring about 65,000 metric tons of food to 1.3
million people, the FAO wrote. 
Measures to revive internal trade are “essential” to ease
supply constraints and mitigate further food-price increases,
according to the agency.
