Will the Ebola virus go airborne?

Experts say the possibility remains remote.

An article by Scientific American.  Could Ebola go airborne? That’s the fear set off last week by a New York Times op-ed entitled “What We’re Afraid to Say about Ebola” from Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Although clinicians readily agree that the Ebola virus leaps from one person to the next via close contact with blood and other bodily fluids, Osterholm warned that the risk of airborne transmission is “real” and “until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic.”

But interviews with several infectious diseases experts reveal that whereas such a mutation — or more likely series of mutations — might physically be possible, it’s highly unlikely. In fact, there’s almost no historical precedent for any virus to change its basic mode of transmission so radically. “We have so many problems with Ebola, let’s not make another one that, of course, is theoretically possible but is pretty way down on the list of likely issues," says infectious diseases expert William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University. "Everything that is happening now can easily be comprehensively explained by person-to-person spread via body contact. We don’t have to invoke anything else.” Here is what it would take for it to become a real airborne risk: First off, a substantial amount of Ebola virus would need to start replicating in cells that reside in the throat, the bronchial tubes and possibly in the lungs. Second, the airborne method would have to be so much more efficient than the current extremely efficient means of transmission that it would overcome any genetic costs to the virus stemming from the mutation itself Currently, Ebola typically gains entry into the body through breaks in the skin, the watery fluid around the eye or the moist tissues of the nose or mouth. Then it infects various cells of the immune system, which it tricks into making more copies of itself. The end result: a massive attack on the blood vessels, not the respiratory system.
 
 

Even viruses that are well adapted to attacking the respiratory system often have a hard time getting transmitted through the airways. Consider the experience so far with avian flu, which is easily transmitted through the air in birds but hasn’t yet mutated to become easily spreadable in that fashion among people. What's the hold-up? “The difficulty is that those [flu] viruses don’t have the protein attachments that can actually attach to cells in the upper airway. They have to develop attachments to do that,” Schaffner says. So even if a virus were exhaled, it would need to lodge onto something in another person’s cells that are already prepared for it in the upper airway. “Since the virus doesn’t have attachment factors that can work in the upper airway, it’s very rare for it to go human to human, and then it almost always stops and doesn’t get to a third person,” Schaffner notes. Similarly for Ebola, the virus would have to develop attachments that would allow it to easily attach receptors in the upper respiratory pathway — something that neither it (nor any of its viral cousins) has been known to do in the wild. And yet Ebola already spreads very easily without such mutations. The delicate lock-and-key protein–virus fit required for the virus to successfully latch onto and replicate in the airway has not developed because there is no evolutionary pressure for it to do so; it simply would not be an efficient option. Epidemiologists can take some comfort in that. As the virus continues to circulate through west Africa, it may like any other pathogen continue to acquire genetic mutations. So far, however, there is no indication that Ebola is mutating in a way that could allow it to make the leap from becoming transmissible via contact with body fluids (as it is now) to become a germ that could be transmitted by breathing the same air, according to WHO. With Ebola, "I don't think we have the information at this time to know what the real risk is but it is probably not zero,” says Ebola expert Thomas Geisbert, a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. The incident that put the specter of airborne Ebola on the map was chronicled in the book The Hot Zone, wherein, in 1989, the virus was apparently spread via the air from monkey to monkey (although it did not make the leap to humans working in the lab). But experts have subsequently wondered if that lone circumstance of primate-to-primate air transmission was fueled by the lab setting and man-made systems. As Osterholm notes in his piece, in 2012 researchers found that a strain of Ebola was spread from pigs to nonhuman primates via the air in a different lab setting. The virus, however, did not then spread from monkey-to-monkey in those circumstances. Questions remain about the current strain of Ebola thriving in west Africa. Apart from the environmental, economic and social circumstances that have fueled its spread, does the virus itself have special characteristics that set it apart? Is it, for example, growing faster or at higher viral concentrations than previous strains? But the jury is still out on this and other questions. Right now we have few answers about this Ebola strain, yet we do know that a massive injection of finances and personnel will be needed to contain it in the months ahead. As of Friday it had claimed more than 2,400 lives.

I would disagree with the 2 requirements proposed to be necessary for ebola to become airborne. First off, replication within the respiratory tract is not essential. High titres in the blood, resulting in spill over into the respiratory fluids is enough.. Indeed this has been demonstrated to other pathogens. Secondly, as is the case with foot and mouth disease virus, a virus can be airborne transmitted, yet still be more efficiently transmitted by the direct contact route AND maintain fitness at the same time. I think that this virus could be producing higher blood titres, therefore increase chances of airborne transmission due to higher viral loads in respiratory secretions. Air sampling these cases would be essential to help rule this in or out.

I won't wade into the debate about airborne transmission. However, mutation to a longer incubation time is likely and would be quite dangerous by promoting wider geographical spread of Ebola.

Funny the Public Health Agency of Canada has has stated: "In laboratory settings, non-human primates exposed to 
ebola virus from  pigs have become infected, however, airborne  
transmission has not been demonstrated between non-human primates"
(My guess is because there were no human volunteers found willing to subject themselves to Airborne mists of Ebola in a Laboratory setting?)

Also interesting: 
TRANSMISSION  From the CDC.
Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs)
Some
 VHFs are spread person to person through direct contact with 
symptomatic patients, body fluids, or cadavers or through inadequate 
infection control in a hospital setting (filoviruses, arenaviruses, CCHF
 virus). Zoonotic spread may occur from contact with the following:
Livestock via slaughter or consumption of raw meat from infected
 animals and, potentially, unpasteurized milk (CCHF, RVF, Alkhurma 
viruses)
Bushmeat, likely via slaughter or consumption of infected animals (Ebola, Marburg viruses)
Rodents via inhalation of or contact with materials contaminated with rodent excreta (arenaviruses, hantaviruses)
Other reservoir species, such as bats (Ebola, Marburg viruses)
Vectorborne transmission also occurs via mosquito (RVF virus) or tick
 (CCHF, Omsk, Kyasanur Forest disease, Alkhurma viruses) bites or by 
crushing infected ticks.

So think about that before sending our troops to Africa, Obama!

I would alike to add that you can fit 110 million viruses on the head of a pin... so how long will one of those stay airborne? And, how small of a particle can on of those paper medial masks filter again???

Yeah, 100 million on the head of a pin, do the math.

The most significant (yet here unmentioned) fact may be the shape of the virus - rather than being compact and exposing fewer targets to an immune system, despite not being a large virus it's a filament: the shape most likely to remain suspended in air as a result of Brownian motion. It does seem unlikely that that's a coincidence or artifact, though it may be so.

 There also seems to be a tacit assumption that it is a feature of the virus that it somehow avoids the lungs. (Which is, nonetheless, not true of how it acts in pigs.) Instead, it seems likely that its quick success vs core organs of humans, such as the kidneys happens before a deep or prolonged fever develops, sparing the lungs. Lungs are necessarily cooler than most organs, so they become relatively attractive hosts/targets only during  fevers. This means that the virus need only become somewhat less effective in order to begin to target the lungs and become as airborne in humans as it already  is in pigs. Evolutionarily, losing capability is vastly easier than adding it, so that's hardly unthinkable.

Experience with other viruses with other shapes, and the stability of their vectors of transmission (which we weren't able to measure for the early U.S. cases of the Spanish Flu, in any case) may not be relevant to filoviruses - and there are only three, and we haven't known of them for long. 

We don't know what we don't know.

Psuedotyping a lenti allows for efficient infection of airway epithelium:
http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v19/n3/abs/nbt0301_225.html

Is this evidence that airborne transmission is more possible that supposed? Why or why not? Thanks!

"Similarly for Ebola, the virus would have to develop attachments that would allow it to easily attach receptors in the upper respiratory pathway—something that neither it (nor any of its viral cousins) has been known to do in the wild... The delicate lock-and-key protein–virus fit required for the virus to successfully latch onto and replicate in the airway has not developed..."

This is simply not true. It is apparent from scientific observation that the Ebola virus
quickly attaches to and replicates in the respiratory tract of non-human primates, so it must be able to easily attach to receptors in the upper and lower respiratory system; a lock-and-key protein-virus fit has already developed. Since Ebola quickly kills non-human primates via the respiratory tract, we should take precautions to prevent the same from happening to humans.

“The potential of aerogenic infection by Ebola virus was established by using a head-only exposure aerosol system. Virus-containing droplets of 0.8-1.2 microns were generated and administered into the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys via inhalation. Inhalation of viral doses as low as 400 plaque-forming units of virus caused a rapidly fatal disease in 4-5 days… Immunocytochemistry revealed cell-associated Ebola virus antigens present in airway epithelium, alveolar pneumocytes, and macrophages in the lung and pulmonary lymph nodes; extracellular antigen was present on mucosal surfaces of the nose, oropharynx and airways. Aggregates of characteristic filamentous virus were present within type I pneumocytes, macrophages, and air spaces of the lung by electron microscopy. Demonstration of fatal aerosol transmission of this virus in monkeys reinforces the importance of taking appropriate precautions to prevent its potential aerosol transmission to humans.”

The 2012 Canadian study (at least the one I'm aware of) does _not_ indicate transmission from pigs to monkeys via air:

From the text of the study:

"Under conditions of the current study, transmission of ZEBOV could have occurred either by inhalation (of aerosol or larger droplets), and/or droplet inoculation of eyes and mucosal surfaces and/or by fomites due to droplets generated during the cleaning of the room."

Also from the study:

"The experimental setting of the present study could not quantify the relative contribution of aerosol, small and large droplets in the air, and droplets landing inside the NHP cages (fomites) to EBOV transmission between pigs and macaques. These parameters will need to be investigated using an experimental approach specifically designed to address this question."

The author of the New York Times op-ed piece makes the same mistake in his interpretation.

I agree that this issue needs attention, but not misinformation.

Great paper came out this week about mapping ebola origin and transmission using the variations in the ebola genome from different affected countries: https://sciencescape.org/paper/190166156

"Because many of the mutations alter protein sequences and other biologically meaningful targets, they should be monitored for impact on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response."
