Avoid greetings and hugs. Ebola is here. This weekend was Eid Al Adha and that was the message being sent to everyone by a local mobile phone carrier. The message is strangely festive and sinister at the same time.                  Countries   Africa Algeria Burundi Central African Republic Chad Comoros Islands Côte d'Ivoire Democratic Republic of Congo Djibouti Egypt Eritrea Ethiopia Guinea Emergency 2014 - Ebola outbreak BLOG: Ebola crisis Kenya Liberia Libya Madagascar Mali Mauritania Niger Sierra Leone Somalia South Sudan Sudan Tanzania Tunisia Uganda Zimbabwe Americas Asia Eastern Europe Middle East                                      WFPICT EmergencyCountriesAfricaGuineaEmergency 2014 - Ebola outbreak           Emergency - Ebola Outbreak, West Africa                             The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) has not yet been activated in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, though discussions are ongoing. There is a clear need across the three affected countries for ETC services. At this stage, the agreement is that the World Food Programme (WFP), as global lead of the ETC, will respond as if the cluster was activated. As such the ETC, its partners and membership are responding together for a coordinated response.  Organizations are encouraged to share ICT updates with the Global ETC Support Cell.

Photo: IRIN/Tommy Trenchard   An outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus was first reported in Guinea in March 2014 and since then has spread to neighbouring Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. It is the deadliest outbreak of the virus ever.     To date over 1,000 people have died and over 1,800 have been infected with the virus. More than 1 million people across West Africa have been affected. The outbreak has put severe pressure on the livelihoods of the populations of all affected countries, disrupting production, trade, routine immunization of chidren and other efforts to fight infectious diseases. Schools have been forced to close and hospitals are being overwhelmed.   The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an International Public Health Emergency. Humanitarian organizations are mobilising people and resources to prevent the spread of the virus and support the affected communities.  Sources: BBC, World Food Programme (WFP)           Although the ETC has not been officially activated in response to the Ebola crisis, the humanitarian ICT community is working together in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
