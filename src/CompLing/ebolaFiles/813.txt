Four Indian doctors of a private hospital of India, Primus Super Specialty Hospital in Abuja, Nigeria, have decided to shirk responsibility and return India as they fear for their own lives first due to the recent outbreak of the pandemic disease. Though there have no such Ebola cases reported in Abuja but these doctors have asked the embassy to ensure their return. They say they are being forced to treat the patients suffering from Ebola virus. On the other hand the hospital is clearly condemning their actions, stating that their ‘no such cases of Ebola virus in Abuja’ and that rest of the doctors are there together except for these four doctors. Their families in India have appealed to the Government to ensure their return back home and also have blamed the hospital management for forcing them to treat Ebola patients despite being untrained for the same.The medical fraternity is prompted to condemn this act of selfishness. They say that they are keeping their own interests above all, though ethically and legally, but it will bring bad name for India. They are duty bound to render services uninterruptedly but they are shrinking from their pious duty in this hour of need.The stranded doctors say that though the cases are in Lagos, but it is Nigeria itself. Moreover Nigeria is not a big country; the pandemic disease may reach out to Abuja also as the patients are treated there. It’s a national emergency in Nigeria, which is declared by the President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan. Since it is a national emergency in Nigeria, the doctors say that Abuja too can get affected as it receives patients from Lagos as well. Though there was no such Ebola case in the hospital where they are working, as these doctors admitted, but there is an Ebola isolation ward created there and it is not guaranteed that no such case will even come in near future.The doctors also said that since this pandemic is life threatening, and they are not trained to treat such a critical disease, they can’t be forced to attend such cases. They therefore have been asking the embassy to help them get their way out from Nigeria.On the other hand Syed Akbaruddin, Spokesperson, Ministry of External Affairs said that there is no such diplomatic issue between India and Nigeria, as the doctors are working for the private hospital in Nigeria. He said that the hospital is Indian owned, Indian established and Indian run, the doctors are Indian. He acknowledged the fact that Ebola is present in Lagos but he also said that this nearest case is in Lagos which is several kilo meters away from Abuja. As of now there is no such case in Abuja. “Neither our high commission in Abuja nor our camp office in Lagos has issued any advisory for Indians to leave those places.”Related PostsEbola Alert: Six Passengers Return From Ebola-Struck Liberia, Isolated At Delhi AirportHow Is American Youth Growing?Catastrophic Ebola Outbreak In West Africa: WHO Declares It To Be An International Public Health ‘Emergency’Eradicated Smallpox Virus Found in a Storage RoomAn Experimental Ebola Drug ZMapp Heals All Ebola-Infected Monkeys In Study!My Daughter Needs To Learn These Seven Lessons To Make Her Life PerfectThanks for rating this!
