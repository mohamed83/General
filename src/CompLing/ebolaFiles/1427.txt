Will Ebola in West Africa Affect China’s Aluminum Industry? SMM Analysis

SHANGHAI, Sept. 10 (SMM) – Mining operations and ore shipments have been halted and disrupted by the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, which has claimed thousands of lives in the region. 
Will Ebola in West Africa affect the Chinese  aluminum  industry, or in which ways? 
Annual output of bauxite in Guinea, Ghana, Sierra Leone, three virus-stricken countries, accounts for 7.81 per cent of world’s total, slightly lower than Indonesia’s 10 per cent. 
 
Chinese enterprises have been looking for new suppliers since Indonesia’s export ban on unprocessed ores, and African countries have become new choices. 
 
However, the impact on Chinese aluminum industry should be small for the foreseeable future from the ongoing Ebola crisis in West African countries, Liu Xiaolei, SMM’s aluminum analyst expects. 
 
“Africa now is not a major supplier of China’s bauxite imports, and imports from the region are about 5 per cent of China’s total imports”, he said. 
 
“The international bauxite supply, however, may tighten as the outbreak of Ebola virus will affect bauxite exports from these countries”, he foresees. 
 
Besides, construction of alumina smelters in African countries will be also delayed by Ebola disease, he added.
