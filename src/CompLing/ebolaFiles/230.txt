Speaker(s): Edwin Trevathan 
The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa reminds global public health officials of the difficulties in coordinating preparedness and epidemic response efforts across borders, and among people who distrust local and foreign government officials and health workers. Edwin Trevathan will discuss how global health diplomacy, as a tool for global health preparedness and response, offers the potential to improve implementation of effective control and prevention methods for Ebola, and for other emerging threats.

He was Director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.He was the CDC’s Strategic Lead for the pediatric response to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, and was a senior investigator for epidemic investigations of Nodding Syndrome in Uganda. He has published widely in public health, epidemiology, neurological and developmental disabilities, multi-center clinical trials, and child health. His new research interest, working with experts at King’s College London, focuses on Global Health Diplomacy in conflict-affected countries.
