Ontario Hospital Treating Patient With Ebola-Like Symptoms




















A hospital in Ontario, Canada, is testing a patient who recently traveled from Africa for Ebola, health officials announced on Friday.The person was exhibiting symptoms that were common to Ebola as well as other diseases, like malaria, officials said. "Ontario's health care system is prepared to respond should an individual arrive with symptoms that could suggest a disease, such as Ebola," Dr. Graham Pollett, interim Chief Medical Officer of Health, said in a statement. "To date, there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in Ontario and the risk to Ontarians remains very low."The Health Ministry did not specify where the patient was being treated or where they had come from — or even a gender — but the Ontario Star and the Associated Press reported that the person had recently arrived from Nigeria and was being isolated in Brampton Civic Hospital. The World Health Organization said Friday that Africa's Ebola epidemic was a global health emergency and could continue spreading for months. The virus has killed nearly 1,000 people this year.
