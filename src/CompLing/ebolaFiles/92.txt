In an attempt to bring out a treatment for Ebola, Durham drug developer BioCryst Pharmaceuticals plans to test a new drug in humans early next year.
The drug, called BCX4430, has shown promise in treating Ebola virus and the similar Marburg virus in rodents, but has not been tested in humans. BioCryst (Nasdaq: BCRX) hopes to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the treatment in humans for the first time, called a Phase 1 trial, soon.
BioCryst has a contract with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the Health and Human Services department, that could be worth up to $22 million to develop the treatment.
"We have been closely following the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Our hearts go out to those impacted,” Jon Stonehouse, BioCryst CEO, said during a quarterly conference call with analysts. “These events serve as a sobering reminder of the importance of government preparedness for these dangerous infectious disease threats and outbreaks. Timely and adequate government funding for potential life-saving therapies for these deadly viruses is essential to develop, gain approval and ultimately get important drugs stockpiled. Waiting until an emergency is too late. So we will continue to work closely with our NAIAD and (Department of Defense) colleagues to advance this program as quickly as possible through the completion of preclinical development and Phase 1 clinical testing. And in parallel, we will seek additional advanced development funding to get this program to the finish line.”
BioCryst shares have traded significantly higher since the Ebola breakout hit headlines.
