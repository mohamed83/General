As the death toll from Ebola continues to rise, its impact is being felt in yet another way: children losing their parents. Preliminary reports from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone suggest that the number of children orphaned by Ebola has spiked in the past few weeks and is likely to double by mid-October.
“Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence,” said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Regional Director for West & Central Africa. “The vast majority of the children affected by Ebola are still left without appropriate care. We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far, far more resources.” 
Ebola is also exacting a heavy emotional toll on children, especially when they or their parents have to be isolated for treatment. As it accelerates its Ebola response, UNICEF is looking at new and traditional ways to help provide children with the physical and emotional healing they need.
