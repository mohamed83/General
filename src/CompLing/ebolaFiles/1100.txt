Their healthcare systems are already very thin, and what it does is tear why little is there to shreds. It's a systems issue as much as a disease issue. When not even a single doctor or nurse can be lost, losing hundreds effect is massive. As much as scientists are studying the disease, the reality is the models that need to be put in place are both sociological and economic to understand the externalities of the disease. What the complex systems effects are to these country from losing so many healthcare workers, and the general economic impacts. This is the thing while many will cite AIDS and Malaria, many of these countries have adapted their systems to those impacts. In addition they externalities of both are different then ebola.  It should be noted this ebola issue is still in it's early stages, we have yet to see what the full impact will be. ﻿With Ebola crippling the health system, Liberians die of routine medical problemsWashington PostWith hospitals crippled from the epidemic, Liberians are dying of preventable or treatable conditions, such as malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia.4Add a comment...
