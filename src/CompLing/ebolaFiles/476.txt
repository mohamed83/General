For instance, this means that Liberia would see its gross domestic product slashed by 11.7 percentage points — from a 6.8 percent growth to -4.9 percent.Families that were very vulnerable to food price shocks even before the outbreak are now suffering the effects of inflation like food shortages, panic buying and speculation, as well as volatile exchange rates fueled by uncertainty and capital flight.On top of that, World Bank specialists believe the worst economic effects will not be because of direct costs like mortality or lost productivity, but rather indirect costs associated to fear of contagion. The analysis bases that contention on lessons learned from SARS in the early 2000s and the swine flu epidemic in 2009, where human behavior accounted for up to 90 percent of the economic impact of those outbreaks.“It won't be just the health care sector that we have to look at. We are going to have to make inputs in agriculture [and] in many aspects of the economy,” Kim said during the media briefing. “So we are really in the process of rethinking our overall envelope for these three countries and any affected countries.”Moving forward, the World Bank analysis recommends four priority sectors for international assistance at this time:● Humanitarian support for health workers and facilities.● Budget support to address the fiscal gap in affected countries, estimated at $290 million for 2014 alone.● Deployment of screening facilities at ports of entry to enable the flow of both aid and trade.● Strengthening the capacity of African health systems for surveillance, detection and treatment to prevent future outbreaks.On the last priority sector, Kim said he believes it’s time to change the conversation and start talking more seriously about universal health coverage and how it will “help us respond much more effectively in the future to these kinds of epidemics.”How to overcome fearEver since Ebola was first detected in May, gross misunderstanding of the virus and how to deal with it has seriously hampered efforts by health workers to contain the outbreak in West Africa.Devex has reported how the huge media attention to the steadily rising death toll has created the public perception that contagion — or even just showing symptoms without getting tested — is already a death sentence that has left clinics empty of both patients and staff, farms abandoned, and supposed and real victims roaming around just waiting to expire.So what can we do to address this “fear factor?”Francisco Ferreira, the World Bank’s chief economist for Africa, suggested to fast-track efforts to bring the epidemic under control by reducing the number of cases and mortality rate as well as providing more treatment centers, and at the same time carry out an “active, urgent and comprehensive” communication campaign for the population to understand the disease.One of the main problems, he told Devex, is that affected communities are convinced that the mortality rate is 90 percent, when in fact current statistics show it’s just 53 percent. In at least one hospital managed by Médecins Sans Frontières, the mortality rate has gone down to only 20 percent after implementing the appropriate treatment protocols.“It’s a serious disease, let’s not kid ourselves, but the chances of survival are higher than we anticipated,” Ferreira said.That message really needs to reach the people, and so far neither health workers on the ground nor the governments of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been able to get it across. Would this have changed if more outside help had arrived from the beginning? Probably yes, but it’s not too late.“We all recognize that the international community didn’t respond as quickly in the early phases as it should have, but now we are catching up,” Ferreira said. “We are helping to provide these people the services they need to reduce this fear, and therefore reduce the economic impact [of Ebola].”Read more development aid news online, and subscribe to The Development Newswire to receive top international development headlines from the world’s leading donors, news sources and opinion leaders — emailed to you FREE every business day.About the authorJenny Lei RaveloFollow @JennyLeiRaveloJenny Lei Ravelo is a staff writer for Devex.
