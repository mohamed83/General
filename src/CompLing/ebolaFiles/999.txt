Ray of Light teams up with Tony winners Greg Kotis and Mark Hollmann, the brains behind the smash-hit Urinetown, to develop the West Coast premiere of this bizarrely hilarious rock musical.In the year 3,000,458,000 B.C., the salt-eating yeasts are the only living creatures on earth, and they’re up against a food shortage, a strange new emotion called “love” and the oppression of a tyrannical king. When the king’s dreamer of a son ventures out of the known yeastiverse, the yeasts’ story – and ours – is changed forever.

Each day, they saved some of their stool, and later, they extracted DNA from it to figure out which species of bacteria were living in their guts. David also spat some of his saliva into a tube each day so that he could compare how his microbiome changed in his gut compared to his mouth.
