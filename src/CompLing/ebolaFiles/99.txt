turmoil: Benghazi hit by air strikes and clashes","excerptText":"Gunfire and air strikes have been reported in Libya's second city, Benghazi, amid an offensive to drive out Islamist militias.<p>The offensive is said to involve forces loyal to ex-general Khalifa Haftar, who is also reportedly backed by the army.<p>Egypt has denied a report by the Associated Press news agency that its aircraft bombed targets in Benghazi.<p>Libya has been gripped by a power struggle between the militias who drove out Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.<p>The interim government, recognised internationally, has fled to the city of Tobruk because of unrest in the capital, Tripoli.<p>However, militias who control Tripoli and Benghazi have announced the formation of their own government.<p>Mr Haftar this week announced

For instance, the Pentagon referred to the war in Iraq as Operation Iraqi Freedom until 2010, and still calls its Afghanistan campaign Operation Enduring Freedom.<p>If \"Operation Inherent Resolve\" is somewhat less ambitious, the unveiling comes a day after military leaders from 22 nations met with top U.S. military brass outside Washington in an effort to coordinate strategy and define missions for the partner nations.<p>The meeting was held amid concerns that hundreds of U.S. and allied airstrikes have yet to turn the tide. Fighting units from the Islamic State have still advanced on towns, particularly in parts of Iraq's Anbar province and on the Syrian border town of Kobani.<p>U.S. Central Command announced 18 more airstrikes near Kobani on Wednesday.

One Really Knows What Happened To Kim Jong Un","excerptText":"Kim Jong Un, the 31-year-old \"semi-divine\" leader of the world’s most secretive state, has not made a public appearance in almost 35 days.<p>Rumors have been flying about what happened to the dictator — some say he's having health problems, some say someone else has taken control of the country, and others speculate the regime is about to topple.<p>Three months ago, North Korea's state media broadcasted footage of the hereditary leader quickly limping onstage at the anniversary memorial service of his grandfather and the nations' founding president, Kim Il Sung:<p>Here is a roundup of possible reasons why Kim Jong Un is MIA:<p><b>Swiss cheese addiction</b><p>Kim Jong Un's weight apparently ballooned after developing an addiction to Swiss cheese. The excess weight reportedly caused stress fractures in both of his ankles which later required surgery.<p>Apparently, obesity does greatly increase your risk of getting ankle fractures.<p>Kim reportedly grew fond of the cheese while he was at boarding school in Switzerland, according to The Telegraph.<p><b>Bum ankles from heeled shoes</b><p>Another theory is that the North Korean leader tripped while walking in his 'Cuban heels' (stylish heels designed for men), according to the Korean news outlet The Chosun Ilbo.<p>According to the report, Kim Jong Un wore the heels while touring an exhaustive number of Cuban military bases and factories.<p>Speculation about the Swiss cheese addiction and fractured ankles started after Kim failed to attend last month's meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, one of the country's biggest events.<p>North Korean state TV reportedly admitted that Kim was ill.<p><b>Gout</b><p>And then there is a chance that the leader may have gout, a form of arthritis characterized by sudden attacks of pain and tenderness in joints.<p>The gout is said to have been brought on by excessive binge drinking, smoking, and again, an abnormal consumption of Swiss cheese, The Guardian reports.<p><b>Political coup</b><p>Despite the perception that Kim has absolute power in North Korea, officials have apparently been criticizing Kim and disagreeing with his policies recently, which has led to speculation about a possible coup.<p>This is rather unlikely since people have been predicting the demise of the North Korean regime for decades, but there are some signs that this is a possibility.

He died on Wednesday.<p>Pham received a transfusion on Monday containing antibodies to fight the virus, according to a Catholic priest in Pham's congregation. Her patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, did not receive one because he did not match the donor's blood type.<p>Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse has said that Kent Brantly, a doctor who survived an Ebola infection, donated plasma to Pham.<p>“I’m doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers,\" Pham said in a statement released by the hospital. \"I am blessed by the support of family and friends.\"<p>The hospital has been criticized for not admitting Duncan the first time he went there days after arriving in the country from Liberia, one of the worst-hit places along with Sierra Leone and Guinea.<p>In an effort to contain the spread of an outbreak beyond West Africa, where at least 4,400 people have died, officials say they are monitoring about 50 healthcare workers who cared for Duncan, doubling down on safety protocols and asking for more public funding to fight the disease.<p>Ebola, which can cause fever, vomiting and diarrhea, spreads through contact with bodily fluids such as blood or saliva.

A Private Meeting, Janet Yellen Reportedly Told People She Still Feels Good About Growth","excerptText":"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen remains confident in the US economic expansion.<p>According to a new report from Bloomberg's Rich Miller, Yellen told members members of the Group of 30 over the weekend that she remains confident in the durability of the US economic expansion despite slowing global growth and turbulent financial markets.<p>Miller's report cites two people familiar with Yellen's comments who asked not to be named because the meeting was private.<p>The report said Yellen told the G-30 that inflation will eventually rise back to the Fed's 2% target with the unemployment rate expected to fall further.<p>Yellen's comments over the weekend largely echoed her most recent public comments, made on September 17 alongside the Fed's latest monetary policy decision, which said that the Fed sees the economy growing at a moderate pace going forward.<p>This report also follows the Fed's latest Beige Book report on economic activity, which showed that the economy continues to grow at a modest to moderate pace, as it has for the last several months.<p>On Twitter following the Beige Book, Deutsche Bank economist Joe LaVorgna said, the Fed's Beige Book was \"nothing new, it's more of the same.\"<p>On Wednesday, stocks in the US were selling off hard, with the Dow falling

There was immediate speculation that the Internet version of HBO might be differentiated in some way from the service that cable and satellite subscribers receive.<p>In the context of the Internet service, Plepler pointedly did not mention HBO GO, the network's popular app for cable and satellite subscribers.<p>But he said the network would work with its existing partners and \"explore models with new partners.\"<p>HBO could try to sell its Internet service to homes that have broadband Internet, but not cable. After all, many of the same companies that sell cable TV packages also sell broadband Internet subscriptions.<p>\"First, we're going to look at the ten million broadband-only homes with our partners,\" Plepler said in a Q&A during the event.

The New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils are atop the division and it doesn't look like simply a fluke.<p>What's particularly notable is that each team has been outstanding offensively. It's not as shocking for the Islanders because they were expected to score, but if there's one thing that has never been a given for the Devils, it's offense.<p>That's why the team invested so much in two-time 30-goal scorer Mike Cammalleri in free agency this year. The early returns on that investment are quite positive as Cammalleri has scored four of the team's 13 goals to start the season, with at least one in each of their three games to start.<p>Above the goals, though, it's the shots that Cammalleri is generating that really stand out. He has 14 shots on goal through the first three games, seven more than any other Devil. Because New Jersey's low-event system can be so oppressive even to the team's own offensive players, having a primary shooter like Cammalleri could help offset the systemic limitations on offense, if only slightly. If he's got a lane, he's taking the shot and there hasn't been enough of that in New Jersey lately.<p>Everything written for the next few weeks will come with the caveat that it's too early to know. We know that Cammalleri won't sustain 24 percent shooting, so the goal pace will obviously slow, but having a player that is so aggressive offensively and has a history of being able to score makes this Devils team a lot more dangerous than it was last year.<p><b>Team of the Day:</b> The New York Islanders are off to a sensational, explosive start to the season. Everything is clicking offensively with 15 goals to start the young season. A four-goal outburst against the Rangers in the third period of Tuesday night's game against their local rivals was somewhat eye-opening. Brock Nelson and John Tavares have seven points each, with Nelson scoring goals on four of his five shots so far this season. Additionally, new arrival Johnny Boychuk has already made his presence felt with five points to start the season. The Isles haven't even gotten the best work out of Jaroslav Halak yet. The team speed, the depth of scoring talent and improvement in essentially every position makes this Islanders team seem like it's for real even at this early stage of the season.<p><b>Daily Digits:</b> <i>4 –</i> Consecutive games …","sourceURL":"http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/eye-on-hockey/24753141/nhl-wraparound-mike-cammalleri-providing-spark-for-devils","allowFullscreenImage":true,"inlineImage":{"mediumURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/imgur.com/5e323a8af7a0b9c150810d8fb77c7c1c7ab9f020/original.jpg","smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/imgur.com/5e323a8af7a0b9c150810d8fb77c7c1c7ab9f020/thumbnail.jpg","original_width":640,"original_height":422,"original_hints":"color,domcolor-e1e7df-161719-33353a-63635a-bbc2bf-8d918f-324b78-903323-e9da43-e5df9c-dfca34,focus-320-210,photo,rgb-132-129-120,still"},"readButtonCaption":"Read Article","sourceMagazineURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/flipmag?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.flipboard.com%2Fcbssports.com%2Fgig_3Dcurated_3Ainlineaml_3Dtrue%2F6798ebca01bf4037a7a55d6ed9d6118ff29411be%2Fe0116cf3d2aa4d7dfa7ef751556cda643b949adc%2Farticle.html&campaignTarget=flipboard%2Fcurator%252Fmagazine%252FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%253Am%253A142274591&partner=cbs-sports&tml&section=flipboard%2Fcurator%252Fmagazine%252FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%253Am%253A142274591&fallbackTml","article":{"sectionID":"flipboard/curator%2Fmagazine%2FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%3Am%3A142274591","partnerID":"cbs-sports","url":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/cbssports.com/gig_3Dcurated_3Ainlineaml_3Dtrue/6798ebca01bf4037a7a55d6ed9d6118ff29411be/e0116cf3d2aa4d7dfa7ef751556cda643b949adc/article.html","urlJson":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/cbssports.com/gig_3Dcurated_3Ainlineaml_3Dtrue/6798ebca01bf4037a7a55d6ed9d6118ff29411be/e0116cf3d2aa4d7dfa7ef751556cda643b949adc/article.json"},"language":"en,h=0","inlineItems":[{"type":"image","title":"","sourceURL":null,"hideOnCover":true,"image":{"mediumURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/neulion.net/d2317bab4a96c0006f770175ae7586eb2004e105/original.jpg","smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/neulion.net/d2317bab4a96c0006f770175ae7586eb2004e105/thumbnail.jpg","original_width":640,"original_height":360,"original_hints":"color,dark,domcolor-181e1c-272a28-383a38-12273d-4a4845-bcc0c4-655d59-a3a7ac-907063-878b90-6b7379-43566e,focus-320-180,photo,rgb-69-63-58,still"},"service":"flipboard","remoteServiceItemID":"f1dhgm2SRmqBmnAD1rQbMA:a:43591897","dateCreated":1413401409,"ingestionTime":1413401435,"canLike":false,"canReply":false,"id":"flipboard-f1dhgm2SRmqBmnAD1rQbMA:a:43591897-1413401409:img=1","canShare":false,"canFetchCommentary":false}],"articleMarkupJSON":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/cbssports.com/gig_3Dcurated_3Ainlineaml_3Dtrue/6798ebca01bf4037a7a55d6ed9d6118ff29411be/e0116cf3d2aa4d7dfa7ef751556cda643b949adc/article.json","articleStats":{"words":995,"paragraphs":20,"characters":5692},"authorDisplayName":"By Chris Peters","userid":"fl:cbssports.com","authorImage":{"smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/dev_O/featured/97298169/cbs_sports_avatar.png"},"hideTimelineDate":true,"service":"flipboard","remoteServiceItemID":"f1dhgm2SRmqBmnAD1rQbMA:a:43591897","dateCreated":1413401409,"ingestionTime":1413401435,"sectionLinks":[{"type":"author","service":"flipboard","remoteid":"flipboard/mix%2F97298169","title":"CBS Sports","referringText":"CBS Sports","linkType":"user","image":{"smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/dev_O/featured/97298169/cbs_sports_avatar.png"}}],"id":"flipboard-f1dhgm2SRmqBmnAD1rQbMA:a:43591897-1413401409","sortValue":31090277018612,"partnerID":"cbs-sports","flipboardSocialId":"flipboard-f1dhgm2SRmqBmnAD1rQbMA:a:43591897-1413401409","prominence":0.20000000298023224,"nextPageKey":"flipboard-edit-topStories-d3cec4927f/flipboard-1413401375","rssText":null},{"type":"post","title":"Jeremy Guthrie apologizes for 'O's ain't Royal' T-shirt","excerptText":"Jeremy Guthrie held a press conference to explain a T-shirt he wore that read, \"These O's ain't Royal.\"<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Jeremy Guthrie has somehow managed to use the word \"serendipitous\" and wear a T-shirt with the title of a Chris Brown not-suitable-for-radio play song in the same American League Championship Series.<p>The Kansas City Royals right-hander unwittingly created a bit of controversy Tuesday night when he wore a T-shirt that read \"These O's Ain't Royal\" to a post-game press conference following his team's 2-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles in Game 3 of the ALCS, putting them on the brink of sweeping the best-of-seven series.<p>The slogan was a play on Brown's rap song, \"These Girls Ain't Loyal.\"<p>Well, that's the radio version.

It's helpful for me to receive that and understand it and apologize and take the proper steps. You can only do so much. You can't take it back, but you can apologize and never do it again.\"<p>Guthrie, who is Mormon and admittedly not completely in the tune with the hip hop world, said he was given the T-shirt by a fan and did not know the connection to the song.<p>\"I don't know the entire song,\" Guthrie said Wednesday prior to Game 4 at Kauffman Stadium. \"Unfortunately for us in this culture, we are exposed to a number of songs. And for me, if I heard that song 38 times, which I haven't, I've probably heard it three.<p>\"People have already told me on social media sites or face‑to‑face, how can you not know that?

to Talk Like a Politician","excerptText":"October 13, 2014<p>No matter what your political beliefs, you probably long ago reached one conclusion about our nation’s public servants: As much as they love to hear themselves talk, many of them aren’t very good at it.<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. After all, Congress and the executive branch are famously filled with lawyers, wealthy business executives, academics and a sprinkling of doctors and career military officers, among other professionals. These serious and sober-minded roles presumably require critical thinking skills, independent judgment and incisive expression. Right? But if you ask most lawmakers or administration officials about a complex policy issue, they’re apt to spout tired talking points, poll-tested pabulum and stock phrases devoid of substance or originality. Their press releases are formulaic; and their speeches may be full of bluster, but they are short on imagination.<p>Last week, when speaking to an industry group that opposes the Affordable Care Act’s tax on medical devices, Hillary Clinton was vague: “On the tax itself, again, I think we have to look to see what are the pluses and minuses that are embodied in a decision about either to remove or alter or continue this particular piece of the Affordable Care Act.” This came just before she called for more “problem solvers” in Washington and, as politicians are wont to do, set herself above the partisan debate: “I just think we have to get out of the ideological wars that either we can’t change anything or we have to change everything, and begin to be smart and pragmatic problem solvers again.”<p>It’s as if, before entering the political world, they’re all given lessons on how to inspire without making promises, to insult without appearing mean and to be a politician without sounding like one—in other words, to avoid speaking straight.<p>Complaints about political language are hardly new. In a famous 1946 essay, George Orwell groused that it “is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” But if anything, doubletalk and weasel words proliferate now more than ever. They’re a manifestation of both parties’ desires to doggedly stay on message amid a rapacious 24-7 news cycle and the compulsion of some politicians to pass judgment—on Twitter, on TV or in Politico—on most of the issues that surface during it.<p>In doing research for our new book on political rhetoric, we came across five general categories of Washington-speak—t …","sourceURL":"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/how-to-talk-like-a-politician-111841.html#.VD2nWFZOHRp","allowFullscreenImage":true,"readButtonCaption":"Read Article","sourceMagazineURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/flipmag?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.flipboard.com%2Fpolitico.com%2Fgig_3Dcurated%2Fe8b081a6a2783bba5033c2179c641d9e01c7808c%2F6edcb271babe73628c46e8838dc6ecdf805a194e%2Farticle.html&campaignTarget=flipboard%2Fcurator%252Fmagazine%252FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%253Am%253A142274591&partner=politico&tml&section=flipboard%2Fcurator%252Fmagazine%252FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%253Am%253A142274591&fallbackTml","article":{"sectionID":"flipboard/curator%2Fmagazine%2FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%3Am%3A142274591","partnerID":"politico","url":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/politico.com/gig_3Dcurated/e8b081a6a2783bba5033c2179c641d9e01c7808c/6edcb271babe73628c46e8838dc6ecdf805a194e/article.html","urlJson":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/politico.com/gig_3Dcurated/e8b081a6a2783bba5033c2179c641d9e01c7808c/6edcb271babe73628c46e8838dc6ecdf805a194e/article.json"},"language":"en,h=0","articleMarkupJSON":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/politico.com/gig_3Dcurated/e8b081a6a2783bba5033c2179c641d9e01c7808c/6edcb271babe73628c46e8838dc6ecdf805a194e/article.json","articleStats":{"words":1741,"paragraphs":25,"characters":10815},"authorDisplayName":"By DAVID MARK and CHUCK MCCUTCHEON","userid":"fl:politico.com","authorImage":{"smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/dev_O/featured/30760408/politico-200.png"},"hideTimelineDate":true,"service":"flipboard","remoteServiceItemID":"NyfUKy9lQGWYD8yGoyfgvg:a:142274591","dateCreated":1413326700,"ingestionTime":1413402678,"sectionLinks":[{"type":"author","service":"flipboard","remoteid":"flipboard/user%2F3195449","title":"POLITICO","referringText":"POLITICO","linkType":"user","image":{"smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/dev_O/featured/30760408/politico-200.png"}}],"id":"flipboard-NyfUKy9lQGWYD8yGoyfgvg:a:142274591-1413326700","sortValue":31090277018609,"partnerID":"politico","flipboardSocialId":"flipboard-NyfUKy9lQGWYD8yGoyfgvg:a:142274591-1413326700","prominence":0.4000000059604645,"inlineImage":{"largeURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/flipboard.com/b5a81f387bcfce673c9f58ab00df026118bc76c0/original.jpg","mediumURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/flipboard.com/b5a81f387bcfce673c9f58ab00df026118bc76c0/medium.jpg","smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/flipboard.com/b5a81f387bcfce673c9f58ab00df026118bc76c0/thumbnail.jpg","original_hints":"color,corner-br-1024-298-62-58-80,corner-tl-512-554-62-58-80,corner-tr-352-554-62-58-80,crop-512-64-160-192,domcolor-0a0f3d-171d59-232a6c-e2caa6-c6a17a-8d694b-503724-f6eeda-2b337e-343c88-394292,face-576-124-68,focus-576-124,imgnsfw-23,photo,rgb-45-36-29,still","original_width":1024,"original_height":555},"nextPageKey":"flipboard-edit-topStories-0489ec8bd8/flipboard-1413326700","rssText":null},{"type":"post","title":"'White boy' Biden calls tea party 'crazy'","excerptText":"Vice President Joe Biden, in a closed-door meeting with black clergy in South Carolina on Tuesday, referred to himself as \"the only white boy on the east side of Wilmington\" as he recalled his days as a Delaware public defender and pressed faith leaders to elect Democrats this year.<p>He offered a candid critique of Republicans, calling the tea party \"crazy,\" according to a detailed readout of Biden's remarks provided to CNN by a person in the room.<p>\"This is not your father's Republican Party,\" he said, according to the source. \"This is a different breed of cat, man.

Oh please – put your torches and pitchforks away","excerptText":"This fight has been on permanent loop for decades – and the feminists who fruitlessly perpetuate The Issue That Must Not Be Named are often unacceptably ignorant<p>Amal Clooney, prominent human rights lawyer, has today started advising the Greek government in its bid to reclaim the Parthenon Marbles. Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, acquired the 2,500 year old classical Greek sculptures in the early 19th century through a possibly-dodgy deal with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Having always intended them for display in the British Museum, they were placed there in 1816, where they remain to this day.<p>Greece has been making efforts to get them back for a while, to which the British respond with arguments like “but then we might have to give back all the other stuff we’ve pillaged” and “what if they get damaged”, which seems weak when you consider that Elgin’s original transport ship actually sank on the way home and the Marbles had to be retrieved by a team of divers. It’s the world’s most famous case of cultural restitution, and I will follow it with keen interest.<p>Oh, and also, Amal Clooney, née Alamuddin, recent bride of famous actor George Clooney, has possibly changed her last name to either Alamuddin-Clooney or just straight up Clooney. Predictably, everyone is losing their minds.<p>Whether or not women take their husband’s name upon marriage fires up feminists like almost nothing else. The couple’s celebrity status adds fuel to the blaze, as well as Alamuddin Clooney’s status as a high flyer in her own right. As a broad generalisation, the two sides boil down to “that’s patriarchal nonsense in obvious need of rejection” and “leave her alone, it’s none of your goddamn business”. These positions crop up again and again in feminist debate over everything from leg-shaving to breastfeeding, but name changing has become a totemic issue that has us grabbing our torches and pitchforks at a moment’s notice.<p>The real problem is that a conception of feminism centring individual choice runs into problems when we consider that all of our choices are mediated by language and culture. This is true for everybody: nothing that we do or say can spring fully-formed from an inner well of volition, unmediated by social forces. The way we conceive of agency is itself influenced by what we’re taught about our own subjectivity.

The Centers for Disease Control? Texas Governor Rick Perry? The local alderman?<p>In the U.S., the proper role of government in public health is an extraordinarily vexed and complicated question. As a consequence, when a killer hemorrhagic fever shows up on our shores, the dead hand of the past practically guarantees that we will dither in crafting an effective response.<p>Here’s why. The Constitution says nothing about disease, much less quarantines and other draconian and potentially liberty-restricting measures that could halt the spread of an epidemic. This omission reflected the conventional wisdom that such powers should remain the exclusive province of the individual states, each of which had laws governing the matter.<p>In the wake of a yellow fever epidemic in 1793 that killed 5,000 people in Philadelphia, President John Adams pushed for an expansion of federal power over quarantine laws by citing the commerce clause of the Constitution. In his second annual address, for example, Adams encouraged Congress to contemplate “suitable regulations in aid of the health laws of the respective States” on the grounds that “contagious sickness may be communicated through the channels of commerce” -- and commerce was something only Congress could regulate.<p>But most legislators firmly believed that police powers governing public health remained exclusively in the hands of individual state governments. While Adams managed to get legislation passed that gave the federal government the authority to help states enforce quarantines (and only then if they requested assistance), the national government wasn't given any autonomous powers.<p>A little more than two decades later, Chief Justice John Marshall laid out an expansive interpretation of the commerce clause in Gibbons v.

The average life expectancy was about 62 years in 1935 when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, and it's now nearly 79 years. And, as in many things, the baby boomers are at the center of another revolution: unretirement.<p>Many boomers have the ability and the desire to work well into the traditional retirement years. For example, 72% of pre-retirees age 50 and over in a survey published in June by Merrill Lynch and the Age Wave consulting firm said they wanted to work in their retirement.<p>A series of broad, mutually reinforcing changes in the U.S. economy and society are turning an aging population into more of an economic asset than ever before. -<p>Yet the specter of an aging population haunts America. The leading edge of the boomer generation is filing for Social Security and Medicare, with some 10,000 boomers turning 65 every day. The dire demographics of aging seem to inform our discussions, from Senate hearings on retirement to Wall Street research on the economy. Our public discourse about an aging society is along the lines of fear and loathing, paraphrasing the late gonzo writer and baby boom legend Hunter S. Thompson.<p>The demographics of despair start with the observation that many aging boomers haven't saved enough to enjoy a comfortable retirement. The emphasis quickly shifts to the fear that the swelling ranks of aging boomers will drain the economy of its dynamism, dragged down by too few workers supporting too many elders. The forecast grows bleaker with the expectation that a less than robust economy will make it that much harder to pay the tab for Social Security and other old-age programs.<p>But hold on. That same aging boomer population offers the promise and the opportunity of rejuvenating both the economy and our communities.<p>The household economics of unretirement are compelling. Earning even a slim part-time income allows older workers to keep saving or to push off the day they have to tap into their retirement savings. A paycheck makes it practical to delay filing for Social Security benefits too, a savvy financial move. For the average worker, earning a paycheck for an additional eight years — shifting the age of retirement from 62 (the earliest) to 70 years (the latest) — boosts their Social Security benefit by two-thirds or more.<p>A series of broad, mutually reinforcing changes in the U.S. economy and society are turning an aging population into more of an economic asset  …","sourceURL":"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-farrell-boomers-unretirement-20141014-story.html","readButtonCaption":"Read Article","sourceMagazineURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/flipmag?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.flipboard.com%2Flatimes.com%2Fgig_3Dcurated%2F5c6faca525530d8011492fe7c5945bcf0d2b3432%2Fdb1281b2dc0309eca3b52958c2d094fda6aae7b2%2Farticle.html&campaignTarget=flipboard%2Fcurator%252Fmagazine%252FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%253Am%253A142274591&partner=latimes&tml&section=flipboard%2Fcurator%252Fmagazine%252FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%253Am%253A142274591&fallbackTml","article":{"sectionID":"flipboard/curator%2Fmagazine%2FGprEmCNkTBKyT3ITUDHzxA%3Am%3A142274591","partnerID":"latimes","url":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/latimes.com/gig_3Dcurated/5c6faca525530d8011492fe7c5945bcf0d2b3432/db1281b2dc0309eca3b52958c2d094fda6aae7b2/article.html","urlJson":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/latimes.com/gig_3Dcurated/5c6faca525530d8011492fe7c5945bcf0d2b3432/db1281b2dc0309eca3b52958c2d094fda6aae7b2/article.json"},"language":"en,h=0","articleMarkupJSON":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/latimes.com/gig_3Dcurated/5c6faca525530d8011492fe7c5945bcf0d2b3432/db1281b2dc0309eca3b52958c2d094fda6aae7b2/article.json","articleStats":{"words":876,"paragraphs":16,"characters":5432},"authorDisplayName":"By Chris Farrell","userid":"fl:latimes.com","authorImage":{"smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/dev_O/featured/30760163/la-times-200.png"},"hideTimelineDate":true,"service":"flipboard","remoteServiceItemID":"-Zq8cniRQNWuH8UZmaSBJA:a:142274591","dateCreated":1413334247,"ingestionTime":1413401222,"sectionLinks":[{"type":"author","service":"flipboard","remoteid":"flipboard/mix%2F30760163","title":"Los Angeles Times","referringText":"Los Angeles Times","linkType":"user","image":{"smallURL":"http://cdn.flipboard.com/dev_O/featured/30760163/la-times-200.png"}}],"id":"flipboard--Zq8cniRQNWuH8UZmaSBJA:a:142274591-1413334247","sortValue":31090277018603,"partnerID":"latimes","flipboardSocialId":"flipboard--Zq8cniRQNWuH8UZmaSBJA:a:142274591-1413334247","prominence":0.20000000298023224,"nextPageKey":"flipboard-edit-topStories-3edd778851/flipboard-1413328653","rssText":null},{"type":"post","title":"Taylor Swift Unveils Synth-Heavy 'Out of the Woods'","excerptText":"\"I think it's the greatest example of the sound of this album,\" Swift says of song she co-wrote with fun.'s Jack Antonoff<p>At the strike of midnight on Tuesday, Taylor Swift delivered a gift to all the fans that pre-ordered the singer's upcoming \"straight-up pop\" album <i>1989</i>: A synthesizer-heavy new track titled \"Out of the Woods.\" The track was co-written with fun. and Bleachers rocker Jack Antonoff, and \"Out of the Woods\" shares many of the same musical characteristics of uplifting fun. tracks like \"We Are Young\" and \"Carry On.\" Max Martin also helped produce Swift's vocal performance on the track.

One of the questions specifically requested U2 to avoid pushing out albums to all iTunes users again in the future. U2’s lead singer Bono apologized for forcing every iTunes user to download the “Songs of Innocence” album. There were many complaints about the automatic album download so Apple launched a removal tool.<p>Facebook user Harriet Jobson asked the following question: “Can you please never release an album on iTunes that automatically downloads to people’s playlists ever again? It’s really rude.” Bono indicated that the motivation behind the promotion was fear that the album would not gain traction without Apple’s help.<p>“Oops! I’m sorry about that. I had this beautiful idea… might have gotten carried away with it ourselves. Artists are prone to that kind of thing. A drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity, a dash of self-promotion and deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard. There’s a lot of noise out there. I guess we got a little noisy ourselves to get through it,” said Bono in response to Jobson’s question.<p>On September 9th, Bono appeared on stage with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the iPhone and Apple Watch event to announce that the “Songs of Innocence” album is free for everyone with an iTunes account and it was automatically downloaded to every Apple device through iCloud. Over 81 million iTunes users “experienced” the album through iTunes, iTunes Radio and Beats Music. The album also received 26 million downloads. The promotion was considered the “biggest album release in history.” Before this album release, about 14 million customers purchased U2′s music through the iTunes Store since 2003. This album deal was reportedly valued at an estimated $100 million, according to multiple sources.<p>This past week, Apple’s exclusivity agreement for “Songs of Innocence” expired. Apple is now selling the new U2 album for $9.99 on iTunes. Amazon added the new U2 album to the Amazon Prime Music catalog this week and sent out a tweet making fun of Apple’s automatic download controversy:<p>Aside from the “Songs of Innocence” album launch, U2 is also working with Apple on several other projects. “We’re collaborating with Apple on some cool stuff over the next couple of years, innovations that will transform the way music is listened to
