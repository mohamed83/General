Ebola Outbreak Coordination Conference Call

Disaster ResponseFriday, September 26, 2014 - 2:00pmCorporate Citizenship CenterThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Corporate Citizenship Center (CCC) will host a conference call on Friday, September 26 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
Over the past six months, an Ebola outbreak has affected five countries in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone).  The current outbreak is unprecedented in scale and geographical reach: the present West Africa outbreak has a higher caseload than all other previous Ebola crises combined.  Worse yet, the United Nations reports that the outbreak continues to accelerate, with almost 40% of the total cases occurring in the past 21 days.
 CCC’s Ebola coordination conference call will provide updated information on the humanitarian response and the efforts to contain the disease.  It will also detail ways that the business community can help. View the Ebola Outbreak Corporate Aid Tracker.
