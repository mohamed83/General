BOSTON, Mass. (INTELLIHUB) â An electronic information gathering and mapping system similar to the WebBot actually spotted the âhemorrhagic feverâ (Ebola) outbreak in West Africa 9-days before it hit the press following the WHOâs announcement.
According to the Associated Press:
HealthMap uses algorithms to scour tens of thousands of social media sites, local news, government websites, infectious-disease physiciansâ social networks and other sources to detect and track disease outbreaks. Sophisticated software filters irrelevant data, classifies the relevant information, identifies diseases and maps their locations with the help of experts.
However, shockingly, as of Sunday, the HealthMap system has spotted at least 75 potential triggers in the United States along with potentials in Canada as well as Mexico. At this time it has not been announced that Ebola is spreading in the U.S., but predictive models show that we may be less than 9-days away from some type of official announcement based on current data.
Once the announcement is made, under World Health Organization recommendation, U.S. officials will then request the activation of all emergency preparedness and mass fatalities response plans nationwide as we will then, at that point, be in full-blown pandemic level 6 martial law.

Fear Fear Scare Scare Run Run
This is not the problem we need to be solving first. Close the border and arrest all of the politicians then we deal with the rest.

Keep thinking that way.  If ebola spreads here, and I’m stuck in a dense population zone for work right now with a lot of immigrants, illegals, and newly acquired green cardies who travel back to their county of origin often. So I’m not happy about it; I’m never thrilled about the possible contagions, but this makes SARS look like a cakewalk. While I agree that there are many politicians needing to be outed and arrested.  And I agree like crazy about closing our damn borders, and that’s a great start in keeping ebola out of the country.  But you being unworried about this, or assuming it could never happen to Amerikuh?   It just takes one and then it spreads like wild fire.  And I don’t care how un- PC this is, go door to door, if you don’t have papers? GTFO.  I see illegals or possibly newly acquired green cardies use their EBT every damn day.  My taxes pay their healthcare. I’m tired of it!! How sad is it that I was walking out the store the other day and a homeless guy actually said, “it’s so good to see some white people around here.”  Even though America is supposed to be a mixture, those ‘mixtures’ are becoming majority. I can’t even read the store signs in some areas: Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, Mexican; where am I again?? And while they’re at it, check temperatures airports.
