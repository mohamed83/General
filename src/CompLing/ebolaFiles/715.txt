Top 10 Ebola Response Planning Tips: Ebola Readiness Self-Assessment for State and Local Public Health Officials

Ebola Readiness Self-Assessment for State and Local Public Health Officials
 

Background

West  Africa is experiencing the largest Ebola outbreak in history. A severe,  often fatal disease, Ebola can be spread in several ways to others:  through direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with a  sick person's blood or body fluids or objects that have been  contaminated with infected body fluids. Ebola symptoms usually begin  after an incubation period ranging from 2 days to 21 days.
During  Ebola outbreaks, the disease can spread quickly within families and  healthcare settings. Rapid identification of cases is critical. Proper  personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks, gloves, gowns, and  goggles must be used, and proper cleaning and sterilization techniques  must be followed to prevent spread. See CDCs 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa web page for more information about the outbreak, including current case counts and transmission of Ebola.
Purpose

This  document identifies rapidly emerging CDC guidelines for Ebola  applicable to the public health preparedness national standards for  state and local planning. It will:
guide planning and readiness for Ebola response at the state and local levels
assist  state and local public health officials in assessing their  jurisdictions level of readiness for a potential Ebola response  (including individual patients and persons under investigation);
allow state and local public health systems to identify preparedness and operational gaps relative to Ebola
identify resources that will assist state and local jurisdictions in closing self-identified gaps
Public Health Preparedness Capabilities Necessary for Ebola Response

In  March 2011, CDC published national capability standards to guide the  development of state and local public health emergency preparedness  efforts. This document, Public Health Preparedness Capabilities: National Standards for State and Local Planning,  describes the 15 preparedness capabilities necessary for a robust state  and local public health emergency response. In January 2012, the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) published national  capability standards to align preparedness and response efforts of  healthcare systems, healthcare coalitions, and healthcare organizations.  This document, Healthcare Preparedness Capabilities: National Guidance for Healthcare System Preparedness,  describes eight preparedness capabilities that foster integration of  the healthcare sector and public health response efforts. Ebola planning  and response requires readiness in six key public health preparedness  capabilities and one healthcare preparedness capability including:
Healthcare System Preparedness (Healthcare Preparedness Capability #1)
Emergency Public Information and Warning (Public Health Preparedness Capability #4)
Information Sharing (Public Health Preparedness/Healthcare Preparedness Capability #6)
Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (Public Health Preparedness Capability #11)
Public Health Laboratory Testing (Public Health Preparedness Capability #12)
Public Health Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation (Public Health Preparedness Capability #13)
Responder Safety and Health (Public Health Preparedness/Healthcare Preparedness Capability #14)
Ebola Readiness Self-Assessment for State and Local Public Health Officials

The  following resources may help state and local jurisdictions address  self-identified gaps in Ebola response planning. You are encouraged to  review the online resources frequently as information may change over  time.
Healthcare System Preparedness

Considering the  need for appropriate care and infection control of identified patients  and persons under investigation, coordinate with healthcare facilities,  healthcare coalitions, and emergency management to develop local and  state emergency operations plans that address the concerns and unique  needs of healthcare facilities for Ebola response. Assess the readiness  for Ebola response within your jurisdictions hospitals, inpatient and  outpatient healthcare facilities, clinician practices, and other  clinical settings. Specifically, ensure that clinicians who may care for  Ebola patients or persons under investigation are trained on the  following guidance documents and consider the resource needs (such as  PPE and other ancillary supplies) that would be needed to implement the  guidance.

Interim Guidance for Environmental Infection Control in Hospitals for Ebola Virus
Emergency Public Information and Warning

Prepare  risk communication messages for internal staff and the public including  general information on Ebola, risks to the public, risk of  transmission, and protective measures. The following links provide CDC  resources to assist in developing jurisdictional risk communication  strategies and plans.

Podcasts
Information Sharing

Ensure  appropriate personnel are enrolled in information systems and receive  CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) notifications. Maintain situational  awareness within the jurisdiction by regularly visiting the CDC Ebola  website for the latest Ebola information, guidance documents, current  case counts, maps of affected areas, and other CDC resources.  Disseminate information to state and local response partners, including  hospitals, healthcare systems, primary care associations, provider  organizations, local public health partners, and emergency management  partners.

Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (Travel-related Information and Public Health Interventions)

Ensure  that state and local epidemiologic and medical staff have the latest  recommendations for travelers and review the CDC Interim Guidance for  Monitoring and Movement of Persons with EVD Exposure. This interim  guidance is intended to provide public health authorities and other  partners with a framework for appropriate public health interventions  and travel options for persons exposed to Ebola. State and local public  health staff should also assure that travelers have access to current  information on the CDC Travelers Health website, which includes travel  notices and Ebola outbreak information.
