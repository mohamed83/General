CDC chief: Ebola outbreak is 'worse than we feared' 
More than 1,400 people have died from Ebola across West Africa. In Liberia, some 70,000 people are quarantined in a neighborhood of the capital after rioters looted a treatment center claiming the virus was a government hoax. 120 healthcare workers have died of Ebola, and twice as many are infected. Now Dr. Thomas Frieden, the Director of the CDC, who's on the ground in Liberia is calling the outbreak an 'absolute emergency.' Anderson discussed the crisis with Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
