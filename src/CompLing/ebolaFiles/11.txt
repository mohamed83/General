U.S. Offers More Aid for Response to Ebola in West Africa
 06 August 2014



USAID is deploying a team to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak.




Washington ― The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) announced August 5 it will deploy a disaster assistance response team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. government’s response to the Ebola outbreak.
Thus far, the disease has sickened more than 1,700 people, including more than 900 who have died.
The team will be staff members from the agency’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, who will be overseeing critical areas of the response, such as planning, operations and logistics in coordination with other federal agencies such as the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.
Members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also will serve on the DART to lead on public health and medical response activities.
In addition, USAID announced another $5 million in assistance to help ramp up the international community’s Ebola response efforts.
This funding will go toward expanding Ebola outbreak programs the agency already is supporting in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. These programs help trace people who might be infected with the disease, as well as provide health clinics and households with hygiene kits, soap, bleach, gloves, masks and other supplies to help prevent the spread of disease.
USAID is supporting outreach campaigns to provide information on Ebola and its symptoms to the general public and health workers in affected countries who might not be familiar with the disease. These messages are being conveyed through radio, text messages and local media.
In addition to the new funding, USAID has provided $2.1 million to the U.N. World Health Organization and UNICEF for deployment of more than 30 technical experts and other Ebola response efforts.
In a separate August 5 announcement, the U.S. Department of Defense said Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has established an internal Ebola task force to evaluate how the department most effectively can support international efforts to prevent further transmission of the virus.
Navy Rear Admiral John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary, said Michael D. Lumpkin, assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, has been appointed to lead the task force.
There has been no impact on U.S. Africa Command's operations in Africa as a result of the Ebola virus, Kirby told reporters during a news briefing. “But clearly, we're watching this as closely as everybody else is and it's an interagency effort here in the United States.”
A small number of Defense personnel remain on the ground in West Africa, Kirby said, assigned to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (AMRIID) in Liberia.
They have established diagnostic laboratory capabilities there and have provided personal protective equipment to those involved in testing for the disease. The personnel have also supplied thousands of Ebola test kits to laboratory personnel.
No Defense personnel are currently in Sierra Leone, but AMRIID has established diagnostic laboratory capability there as well.
