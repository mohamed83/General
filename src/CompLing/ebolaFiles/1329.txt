          Listen  Listening...              /    Sheilah talks with Rebecca Dineen and Gena O'Keefe, co-leads on "B'more for Healthy Babies".   More than six in every thousand babies in Maryland die before their first birthday.  In Baltimore, the infant mortality rate is even higher – 10.3 deaths in the first year for every thousand live births – although the rate has been heading down in recent years. Five years ago the city of Baltimore overhauled its approach to preventing infant deaths. It created "B'more for Healthy Babies", which has been developed and overseen by our guests today.

          Listen  Listening...              /    Sheilah talks with Minesh Mehta, medical director of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center.   In proton radiation therapy, protons deliver precise beams of radiation to a tumor. The first cancer patient received proton therapy in the 1950s, but only in the 1990s did the therapy make its way into a hospital. Advocates of proton therapy say that it can minimize side effects and that it offers hope to patients who have few or no treatment options left.  Proton centers are opening around the country, and in a year, a proton center will open here in Baltimore at the University of Maryland BioPark. Minesh Mehta, the medical director of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center joins Sheilah by phone. We also hear from Dr. Mehta's patient Daryl Marciszewski, who received proton therapy in Chicago.

          Listen  Listening...              /    Tom Hall talks with Megan Anderson. She's starring in the one-woman play, "Grounded" at Everyman Theatre.   Megan Anderson is a member of the resident company of the Everyman Theatre in Baltimore.  Recently named “Best Actress” by the Baltimore City Paper, she is starring in Everyman’s latest production, the Baltimore premier of "Grounded," by George Brant. It’s a ripped from the headlines affair:  it’s about a former F-16 pilot who is now flying drones from a remote location in Nevada.  It’s also a tour-de-force for Megan Anderson, or any actor, for that matter, as she is the one and only actor in the play.  "Grounded" is in previews tonight and tomorrow.  It opens at the Everyman Theatre on Friday.

It has been three years since we talked to Joani Gammill of Annapolis.  She’s a trained nurse and recovering pill addict who works as an interventionist – a professional who confronts addicts who are resistant to treatment and persuades them to enter treatment. Her first book, "The Interventionist," describes how she works.  Her new book takes us deeper into her own recovery.  It’s called "Painkillers, Heroin, and the Road to Sanity."  Joani Gammill joins Sheilah in the studio.
