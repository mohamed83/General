One of the two infected US humanitarian workers who contracted Ebola while working in West Africa will be treated in an Atlanta hospital. The patient, who is reportedly in a “grave” condition, is expected to arrive within the next several days.

American volunteers who contracted Ebola in
  ‘grave’ condition

  Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, is planning to
  admit the infected patient “within the next several
  days,” the university said in a statement. The institution,
  however, didn’t reveal the name of the patient and the exact time
  of his/her arrival.

“Emory University Hospital has a specially built isolation
  unit set up in collaboration with the [Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention] to treat patients who are exposed to
  certain serious infectious diseases,” said the hospital.

  The patient will be treated in a high-security ward in a special
  isolated unit which was set up in collaboration with the US
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“[The isolation unit] is physically separate from other
  patient areas and has unique equipment and infrastructure that
  provide an extraordinarily high level of clinical isolation. It
  is one of only four such facilities in the country,” the
  statement said.

EU on high alert as Germany agrees to accept Ebola
  patients

  According to the hospital, its physicians, nurses and staff
  “are highly trained in the specific and unique protocols and
  procedures necessary to treat and care for this type of
  patient.”

“For this specially-trained staff, these procedures are
  practiced on a regular basis throughout the year so we are fully
  prepared for this type of situation.”

  According to CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds, the agency is
  working with the US State Department to facilitate the transfer
  of the infected patient.

Fears of global spread of Ebola virus as death
  toll hits 729

  The news of the transfer came after Samaritan’s Purse, an
  international relief group based out of Boone, North Carolina,
  confirmed that Dr. Kent Brantly and missionary Nancy Writebol had
  been diagnosed with Ebola while working in Liberia.

  The organization reported that both patients were in a
  “stable but grave condition.”


  According to the latest data from the World Health Organization
  (WHO), the latest Ebola outbreak has infected about 1,323 people
  and killed at least 729.

  The symptoms include acute fever, bleeding and damage to the
  central nervous system. The fatality rate can be as high as 90
  percent.

  On July 31, the WHO together with West African countries said
  that they are launching a $100 million emergency plan to battle
  the deadly virus.

  There is no cure for the deadly Ebola virus, but companies around
  the globe have been attempting to develop one as the current
  outbreak continues to ravage a region in West Africa.

"The scale of the Ebola outbreak, and the persistent threat
  it poses, requires WHO and Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to
  take the response to a new level and this will require increased
  resources, in-country medical expertise, regional preparedness
  and coordination," said WHO Director Margaret Chan.

  The project includes "several hundred more personnel"
  deployed in the affected areas.

"The plan sets out new needs to respond to the outbreak
  across the countries and bring up the level of preparedness in
  neighboring countries," said WHO spokesman Paul Garwood.
  "They need better information and infection-control
  measures."

  US health authorities have already advised against traveling to
  Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, countries mostly affected by
  the virus as the outbreak "represents a potential risk to
  travelers."

  Sierra Leone cyclist tested for Ebola in Scotland

  A Sierra Leone cyclist has been tested for Ebola after he felt
  sick at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland.

"I was sick. I felt tired and listless. All the doctors were
  in special suits to treat me - they dressed like I had Ebola. I
  was very scared," Sierra Leone cyclist Moses Sesay told the
  Daily Mirror.

  But after four days of examination, the tests came back negative,
  said the spokesman for the games.

"We can confirm an athlete was tested for a number of things
  when he fell ill last week, including Ebola. The tests were
  negative and the athlete competed in his event on Thursday,"
  a spokesman for the games said.

  He also confirmed that there is “no Ebola in the Athletes
  Village of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games."

  According to Scottish health authorities, the incident was
  isolated and no one tested positive for the virus.
