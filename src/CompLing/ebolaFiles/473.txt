Information minister Labaran Maku Thursday criticized sections of media reportage of Ebola outbreak in Nigeria for attempts to create panic in the country.
Maku, who heads a nationwide strategic communication on Ebola, said mostly some international media outlets and at least two local papers—all unnamed—constantly misrepresented Ebola situation in Nigeria in attempts to tarnish the country.
“We wont allow any media house to use the opportunity of this unforatunate Ebola outbreak in Nigeria to begin to run down the corporate image of our country and our people,” Maku said Thursday’s Ebola briefing.
“This will be unacceptable and, if it continues, I can tell you we are going to take measures.”
The Ebola briefings have been regular since the virus came into the country with the death of Liberian American Patrick Sawyer.
It has been the source of updates on new infections, confirmed positives, surveillance numbers and the actions of the emergency operations centre talking Ebola in Lagos, where the outbreak has been confined to just three local government areas.
The international media—from countries as the US, Britain, Germany, China, Iran—has been a regular and strong presence at Ebola briefing. 
International news agencies, cameras and microphones jostle for space with local journalists to get the latest sound bites.
Maku complained that some international media covering Ebola “decide not to report Nigerian case.”
“When they report ebola, they make it look like the 1,000 cases that have died are Nigerians,” he said.
“Why should the Nigerian story be mixed up with others? Report our victims, our effort and what we are doing.
Every time you have a story, you use Nigeria as headline and make the world believe all the cases in West Africa are in Nigeria.
This is unfair, because it is sending unnecessary anxiety across the world. The reality is different.”
Only eight people on record are currently infected and are on treatment. Three others, including Sawyer and two healthworkers who treated him, have died. 
Some 169 are under surveillance, but the numbers continue to fall as those who get through 21 days without showing Ebola symptoms are taken off the list.
