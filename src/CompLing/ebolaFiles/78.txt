#EBOLA: Lagos State Records 5 New Suspected Cases











“The Lagos State government has announced that 5 new suspected cases of Ebola virus have been recorded at the Yaba Isolation Centre. The state Commissioner for health, Dr Jide Idris made this known today while addressing journalists. Dr Idris said that two of the five new cases were from secondary contacts and that 213 people are now being observed



“Till date, we have recorded eight suspected cases, five of which came in yesterday August 19th, 12 confirmed. On the whole, five have died (including the index case). We are currently following up 213 contacts, and 62 have completed the two-day follow-up,” Dr Jide said



Dr. Idris used the opportunity to pay tribute to late Dr Ameyo Adadevoh and other health workers who have so far died from the Ebola virus disease.
 “She, (Dr. Adadevoh) it was, who took the initiative to intimate the Ministry concerning the index case – Liberian-American (Mr. Patrick Sawyer) and substantially to her credit the moderate containment achieved is owed. She led the team who attended to the index case. Her doggedness and commitment to duty saw her personally reviewing the case even though the patient had earlier been seen by a doctor. The Ministry of Health commiserates with their families, co-workers, friends and loved ones on these irreparable losses which was on the line of duty,” he said
