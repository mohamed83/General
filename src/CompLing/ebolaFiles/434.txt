Researchers say that fruit bats are the source of the current Ebola outbreak.





/ebola




















Researchers say that fruit bats are the source of the current Ebola outbreak. A toddler in Guinea contracted the disease from an infected fruit bat, according to research which will be published in the next few weeks. The disease likely migrated via bats from the Congo.

Researchers believe that the virus has travelled via several different bat colonies. The spread of the disease is unlikely due to a single fruit bat. Fruit bats are often eaten as food in rural West Africa. Experts on tropical disease spent weeks conducting research.
