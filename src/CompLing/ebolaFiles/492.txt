A suspected Ebola patient rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba, Delta State capital on Thursday, and caused panic among patients, visitors and workers of the hospital.
According to SaharaReporters, this hospital that is located along the popular Nnebisi and Anwai Roads was almost deserted at the time of the visit as wards and other areas within the hospital were empty.
The Medical Director of the hospital, Dr. Leo Erhunmwunse, who confirmed the accident saying on phone that there is actually a case of suspected Ebola that was rushed to the hospital. “The patient was brought in today after manifesting some of the symptoms of the dreaded Ebola virus such as diarrhea and vomiting, but was yet to be determined if he was infected,” Dr. Erhunmwunse said.
“A patient who was stooling and vomiting was actually brought to the hospital today (Thursday), with symptoms of Ebola but we need to confirm if he is suffering from the disease. We need to carry out series of test to verify if he has the virus or not. People should not panic. The situation is under control,” the doctor added.
The director further added that the hospital will need to conduct a series of tests to determine if the patient actually has the dreaded disease, which could take a few days.
