(Before It's News) In this new edition of Hawk’s radio show with special guest whistleblower and former police officer Greg Evensen, Greg shares more information with us about ISIS (controlled by none other than Barack Obama according to Hawk!) gained from his inside sources. Greg and Hawk warn us that ISIS now has the weaponized ebola virus, here in America! 
 
Warning that there are no rules left, the plan that is now unfolding is an attempt by ISIS to completely disrupt whatever semblance of government is now left in the United States. Evensen joins Hawk shortly after the 1 minute 45 second mark in this bombshell show.

Neither of these two would know a real terrorist if they were sitting on him. They still believe the Neocon 9-11 “Muslims did it” conspiracy fairy story. All we have to do is keep an eye on Israelis setting up cameras to “record the event”, as on 9-11. The “Dancing Israelis”, shipped home by our Zionist government admitted on TV in Israel that they knew what was coming. Of course they did.

Only in the US and Israel? Surely you cant be that naive can you? Your second article shows just how cheap it can be. Why is a concerted effort made to blame the Jews for almost everything? Have you ever thought that the “Jews” are just the curtain knitted together to hide the real guy pulling the leavers? Would if “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” was a tool used to knit together that curtain and create the perfect scapegoat? I get real suspicious when I am continually being pointed to one group of people as to the cause of most things. Though I believe there is a common thread, the Jews (the real Jews) seem awfully convenient to me. A God believing man might think it’s Satanic in nature, greasing the skids for the Antichrist and his slaughter of the followers of Christ and the woman (nation) who brought Him into the world.

Why oh why do all these people who claim “fear porn” “liars” “false prophets” just trying to make money etc. keep clicking on these articles? My favorite is the repeat visitors who say “just trying to get the clicks”! What do they expect to see? The repeat visitors really take the cake; are you looking to be convinced? Then why complain when your not? The way I see it sometimes you have to go through lots of sand and a few nuggets of fools-gold before you get one gold nugget but it’s just as valuable as if you were handed it, perhaps even more so.

Wideawake, no offense… Hawk has demonstrated time and time again that his background source information is just an invention of his vain imaginations. I’ve listened to Hawk off and on since 2005. I quit altogether in 2013. The last 5 years I listened was just to keep track of all his doom predictions that didn’t pan out. I’ll give you a brief idea, Hawk claimed in 2008 that he had inside information the TR3B’s were going to launch a surprise attack. Well obviously his black triangles didn’t do it. Another time Hawk claimed he had insider information of Russian and Chinese troops planning to attack America in 2009 and then again in 2010. As I understand it, Hawk is till beating that dead horse.
Hawk also tends to quote Luke 21:12 way out of context. When Jesus delivered the Olivet Discourse on the Mount of Olives, Jesus was speaking to nation of Israel. Not the church. The Church did not begin until Acts 2. Luke 21:20-27, plainly shows the context is addressed to Israel, and not the Church. The whole point of the tribulation period is God dealing once again with the nation of Israel. 
Hawk claimed Michael the Archangel commissioned him. I find that about as likely as a bear being able to resist an extra cheese pizza. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal. 
2 Corinthians 10:3-4 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
Paul never advocated military resistance against pagan Rome. An empire so evil it tossed Christians to lions for mere entertainment. 
Romans 12:17-21 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.  Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Let’s take Iran, Iran has persecuted Christians terribly, yet in the midst of this persecution… More and more people are becoming Christians there. God has always used times like these to bring true converts and revivals. Yes the world is getting ready for the tribulation period, yes the world is becoming more progressively evil. We are not citizens of this world, we are sojourners in this life. We are to be a light unto the world, not wage carnal war. This world cannot be changed for the better by man. It is folly to even believe so. This world will only be made better when Christ returns. As Christians we should be longing and waiting for his return. 
It is one thing to be prudent, it’s quite another to play on fear and make a lot of $$$ off of Biblically ignorant Christians.

oh, lookie, all the zionophobics have come out to play…just so you know…the word ‘zion’ is mentioned in the Bible 153 times – God seems to approve of zion – I guess that does not bode well for the likes of some of you.
There is a song  – a battle cry – that goes something like this…here is the chorus to it…
‘Blow the trumpet in zion, zion,
Sound the alarm from my holy mountain
Blow ye the trumpet in zion, zion,
Sound the alarm, sound the alarm…great worship song.
I will post the verses, if I have time…you’d be better served, singing a chorus or two of this , than, posting this negative crap that is fit for nothing, but the dunghill.

ISIS is a product of the secret govt. of the US. There is no ‘Organisation’ of terrorists without the US backing them in some way or form ( either training or supplying arms ). Just a smokescreen with a way of directing peoples attention elsewhere. If they  (ISIS) have Ebola in the US , then it is because the US SEcret Govt. wants it there. You live in a Police State already, the Patriot Act enacted that, the next step is Marshall Law due to Ebola, Civil unrest, National Security,Terrorism, or whatever the Government can think of. This article may be small but it shows that the govt. is planting the thought in peoples minds that an Ebola attack causing an outbreak is a real possibility. It makes it more believable and ‘acceptable’ when it does happen. Then they can start the next stage of their grand plan. Open Eyes Sheeple..
