Submitted by Tyler Durden on  08/28/2014 12:00 -0400

















 
More than 20,000 people may be infected with the Ebola virus before the outbreak in West Africa is controlled, warns the World Health Organization. As we noted previously, they believe the costs to fight this epidemic will be $490 million (higher than the previous $430 million estimate) as Bloomberg reports the WHO roadmap released today warns "The 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak continues to evolve in alarming ways." So far, the virus has infected more than 3,000 people, making it the biggest outbreak ever, and has killed more than 1,550. It’s on a pace to cause more deaths than all previous outbreaks combined.
 

 
As Bloomberg reports,






More than 20,000 people may be infected with the Ebola virus before the outbreak in West Africa is controlled and curbing the epidemic will cost at least $490 million, according to a World Health Organization plan.
 
The number of people falling ill is accelerating, with more than 40 percent of the infections happening in the past 21 days, the Geneva-based United Nations agency said in an e-mailed statement today. In some areas, the number of cases may be two to four times higher than reported, the WHO said in a separate document, a so-called road map that lays out the plan to deal with the situation.
 

 
“The 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak continues to evolve in alarming ways,” the WHO said in the road map released today. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone are “struggling to control the escalating outbreak against a backdrop of severely compromised health systems, significant deficits in capacity and rampant fear.”
 
...
 
The WHO’s cost estimate is up from $430 million in a draft of the road map reported by Bloomberg News this week.

One potential trajectory of the outbreak based on current growth...

Lastly, we noted yesterday that Africa GDP was estimated to drop 4% on the 3,000 infected cases so far... one can only imagine the carnage to the nations' economies if the cases hit 20,000...

Whatever adjectives are necessary...
They're asking for $490MM because they realized they're going to get the  $430MM and no one will bat an eye at the additional $60MM. Besides,  this is just the first tranche. Always nice to start with a higer base  when you're feeding at the trough.

“He open his mouth and gasps into the bag, and the vomiting goes on endlessly. It will not stop, and he keeps bringing up liquid, long after his stomach should have been empty. The airsickness bag fills up to the brim with a substance known as the vomito negro, or the black vomit. The black vomit is not really black; it is a speckled liquid of two colors, black and red, a stew of tarry granules mixed with fresh red arterial blood. It is hemorrhage, and it smells like a slaughterhouse. The black vomit is loaded with virus.”

28 Days Later was one of the better zombie flicks. Ebola affects the brain in a matter similar to rabies, according to Preston's book. The virus eats away the higher cognitave functions, while the primitive, reptilian functions remain. 
 
Ebola is most frightening as it reminds us that despite all our god like powers we as a species have accrued in our quest of domination of the planet, we can still be reduced to a quivering, aching, foul tempered mass of cytoplasm in a matter of days by an invisible monster. It challenges our notion of domination and control. It brings home the truth that we are not special.
 
And yes, Dinty Moore is certainly Ebola sludge.

It's definitely the scariest shit I've read about. One of the only things that, I told my wife, if I ever catch, just put me out of my misery. The fucked up part would be finding ways to off yourself that wouldn't spread the disease to family and friends. A gunshot wound to the head would be the last thing to do to keep those around me safe. May have to go the robin williams route.

"A gunshot wound to the head would be the last thing to do to keep those around me safe."
There are a few variables there.   I'm thinking a 12ga to the head on the back 20 acres is neater than a .22 to the head at the family dinner.   You could focus on the positive too.   Think of who you could press your cheeks up against in case of sudden projectile bloody intestinal blowouts.

When it's out of control after 1000 deaths, it will be epic, and exponentially, at 20.000. 
Or do bugs stop eating after 20.000 victims? "Could reach 20.000, confucius say".







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 12:43 | 5154338
Citxmech





Exactly.  Somebody needs to explain why an epidemic that is "out of control" at 2000+ infections could be more controlable once it has spread to 10x that number.







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 12:42 | 5154337
Tall Tom





At a rate of doubling at every TWENTY DAYS it will take 60 Days before 24,000 are infected.
 
So WHO believes that they can control this in 60 days?
 
DO NOT COUNT ON THIS. THEY ARE CRAZY. They understand Exponential Math. They are LYING ASSHOLES AGAIN.







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 12:58 | 5154443

My wife just made an excel chart based upon the WHO data that looks pretty much like the above posted trend chart.  The data points fit the projected trendline at around 90% - which she said might be the best fit she's ever seen for real world data.
This outbreak has shown no sign of slowing down - or in the mortality rate dropping.
 







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 13:36 | 5154686
Alea Iactaest





That's because the data are a lie. If it looks to good to be true (e.g., the "goodness of fit" appears unusually accurate) it probably is. More goal seeked data.
Because you can't handle the truth (off the fucking chart!).







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 14:04 | 5154836
Citxmech





My wife and I both agree that the reported data undercounts actual infections/deaths - but if you were trying to purposefully present manipulated data to calm folks down - why in the world would you use numbers to demonstrate an exponential growth rate?







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 14:04 | 5154844
Alea Iactaest





Why? See my comment below. Perhaps the truth is even worse?







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 14:59 | 5155137
Citxmech





Hm.  Maybe it's because I view exponential functions a bit differently than the herd - but all I need to know to be VERY concerned is:
1. Death rate higher than Spanish Flu? (>2.5%)  Check.  This strain of Ebola is over 50%.
2. Transmissible by casual contact or close proximity?  Check.  In fact, this strain seems to bypass at least low-level protective equipment.  Not good. 
3. Long incubation period?  Check.  2-21 days - and the survivors are potentially contagious for months.  This is really not good.
4. Exponential infection rate?  Check.  
For me, the actual curve/doubling rate is just a factor to judge the spread and effect of potential mutations/attenuations.
I agree that we don't know the current extent of infections/deaths (I'm assuming 3-10x higher than reported) but once confirmed cases exceed 10k - I just don't see much hope in containment after that.







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 14:05 | 5154837
Alea Iactaest





Yes, please give me some more down arrows. Because:
In an action plan to deal with the outbreak, the WHO said that "the actual number of  cases may be 2-4 fold higher than that currently reported" in some  areas.
Source: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28966258
And how many areas aren't counted at all? Congo isn't in the WHO data at this point.

Airlines? A good place to start. Quickly followed by restaurants (pick high PE like CMG) and shopping mall owners (like SPG). From there, if we see real exposure in the West, feel free to short the SPX down 40%+.
Of course, we've seen enough bear traps in the last 4 years that your best bet may to sit this one out 'cause we're going to SPX 2500 by January.

Nice link. I found this gem of a Chinese commenter's view on American settlements and law enforcement:
Actually,  this is exactly how America does it, using violence to beat the Indians  [Native Americans] to death, pushing the Asian, African, and poor out  into the country, running the poor white people into the surrounding  outskirts of the cities. America’s police are even more terrible than  China’s chengguan. If you’re within two meters of a police  officer, you have to raise your hands, otherwise American police have  the right to shoot you dead.

Lol, considering that is Mr Miffed's answer to all things unpleasant in life I am well versed in that tactic. I have come to be in complete agreement in his approach and heartily recommend it! ;-)
As to the short version, yes citxmech I am leaning to that. We may be in the possible containment situation in this country now and if proper decisions are made NOW, I think we may dodge a bullet. I have no comment for Africa if these numbers are truly reflective to what is going on in the field. As with any case, those with money will have the best chance if they move to higher ground in this tsunami. However, if those with cash are infected, they will be the most likely candidates to infect the rest of the world as they stampede out.
Now for the longer version.
I have decided to not venture out on other sites to hear any other opinions. I want facts not conjecture. I believe Hannibal Lecter is instrumental in providing my approach "First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature? What does he do, the man you seek?" So my focus has been trying to understand how this virus works. Only until we understand it will we know what to do. Mount a defense or run? The following is a condensed version of what I have  found in several technical journals. Journal of Virology, Journal of Infectious Diseases and Journal of immunology. I know there is a lot of technical jargon. Please bear with me.
Ebola does have a novel mechanism of enhancement: multiple IgG antibodies bind to GP epitopes in close proximity, allowing the binding of C1 to the Fc region of the antibodies. This complex binds C1q ligands on the cell surface and stabilizes the interaction between the virus and its receptor, increasing the likelihood of viral attachment. THIS IS KEY. This virus is using our own immune response against us!!
C1q ligands have been identified on many cell types, including the monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells that are preferentially targeted by this hemorrhagic virus. Therefore, while antibodies normally protect the body, this virus is able to use them for faster and easier attachment to target cells.
In addition being an essential cofactor for the viral RNA polymerase complex, VP35 has been identified as an inhibitor of multiple components of the interferon ( IFN) pathways. These are a family of cytokines produced in response to viral infection that exert antiviral, cell growth-inhibitory and immunoregulatory activities. Upon viral infection, the IFN response can be triggered by sensors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) protein and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) protein that recognize dsRNA or ribonucleoprotein complexes.However, VP35 is able to disrupt this pathway just as it begins by competing with RIG-1 for the binding of dsRNA. So, Ebola is very efficient in nullifying an immune response early and quickly in initial infection.
The entry mechanism of Ebola virus doesn't appear to be well understood. Many enveloped viruses, Ebola virus included, rely upon endocytosis to infect cells. Several distinct endocytic mechanisms exist in mammalian cells, and can be distinguished by the type of cargo they carry as well as the proteins involved in their regulation. However, all mechanisms ultimately transport virions through successive endocytic vesicles until a compartment with adequate conditions, low pH in the case of Ebola, is reached.Upon membrane fusion, the capsid moves into the cell cytoplasm at a site where replication proceeds optimally.Previous studies to clarify the entry mechanism of Ebola have produced conflicting results, with involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and a Rho GTPase-dependent pathway that may suggest macropinocytosis all being implicated. However, all of these experiments were performed using retrovirus-based pseudotypes in which GP is coated onto the surface of a retrovirus capsid containing a recombinant genome. This removes the need to work in a biosafety level four laboratory, but suffers from non-ideal biochemical characteristics. Only recently have experiments been performed with wild-type Ebola virus Zaire that demonstrate that cellular entry involves uptake by a macropinocytosis-like mechanism. So when the body tries to defend itself, this virus USES THE DEFENSE to gain entry to our cells!! This explains a lot. Especially when the use of passive immunity ( transfusing serum from a person recovered from Ebola) has been spotty in efficacy. 
Knowing this I don't think therapies like ZMAPP will work unless given VERY early in infection, way before symptoms are expressed. 
My conclusion? If this comes here in any serious way the only answer is RUN. 
Note to parrotile. Would you consider marrying a microbiologist whose passport will not buy her residency at Pitcairn? Mr Miffed would be most grateful if you could find him a prospective mate if needed. We have access to a boat that would get us there. We are both low maintenance and great company if that is an inducement.

Thank you Miffed. Honestly I understood about 50% of the medical info, I'll have to give it to my beautiful wife who's a BSN. But you got me thinking, just to stir up the pot a little- Ebola only works in a low Ph blood envirnment? Really? So does Cancer and a lot of other nasty things. Could simple things like Essiac, mushrooms or consuming baking soda help the care givers immune system?

Yes, that peaked my interest as well. I thought of the movie Andromeda strain where the only survivors were the baby and old man who drank sterno. Both represented the high and low ends on the ph scale. If this were a viable therapy I am concerned the ph necessary to arrest replication may be incompatible with human life. We have an extremely narrow ph range that we can tolerate, 7.42 being about optimal.

"Could simple things like Essiac, mushrooms or consuming baking soda help the care givers immune system?"
 
Probably not.  Note that it is the pH of an INTRACELLULAR compartment that is part of the viruse's replication machinery.  Such things are gererally under the control of staunch homeostasis mechanisms.  It's doubtful that consuming baking soda and other such attempts to influence the pH of an intracellular compartment would have any impact.

Probalby not? I respect your opinion but I would disagree. I've heard prostate cancer survivors refusing chemo and only consuming baking soda. Have you done research on Essiac? Mushrooms? They are all natural remedies. I would not let them touch me with chemo. They can take that shit and shove it.

BANGALORE: Gangadasappa, 40, paid a heavy price for playing truant with his creditors: he lost his testicles. 
 On the night of August 4, the moneylenders kidnapped and sedated the  realtor, before surgically removing his testicles, in Anjananagar, near  Magadi, West Bangalore. They later admitted him to KIMS Hospital, where  he is still recovering. He is out of danger, police said, quoting  doctors.

Yes, big news here, Knux.
Almost every airport worker was wearing protective gear of some kind, even people passing through.
Some were detained, but only those showing symptoms, as I understand it.  The rest were let go.
I am not sure it is 'airborne' yet; however, it appears to be very highly potent in its infectious capability. Simply touching the skin of someone can apparently infect you.
Obviously all of the returning patients should have been quarantined until the bug is figured out.
I am glad I flew in the day before to this location from a remote part of the country. However, this could get out of control very fast. I have loaded up on masks and decom equipment from the job site.*****I have a co-worker (former partner) in a central African country now. I have not heard from him although I have emailed him .

The one thing folks need to understand is that "airborne" has a very specific definition.  Even if this variety of Ebola isn't technically airborne - it wouldn't mean that you couldn't be infected by someone sneezing a few feet away from you.  
See the difference between "Droplet Transmission" and "Airborne Transmission" below:
Transmission-Based Precautions
There are three types of transmission-based precautions: contact precautions (for diseases spread by direct or indirect contact), droplet precautions (for diseases spread by large particles in the air), and airborne precautions (for diseases spread by small particles in the air).  Each type of precautions has some unique prevention steps that should be taken, but all have standard precautions as their foundation.
Contact Precautions 

Used for patients/residents that have an infection that can be spread by contact with the person’s skin, mucous membranes, feces, vomit, urine, wound drainage, or other body fluids, or by contact with equipment or environmental surfaces that may be contaminated by the patient/resident or by his/her secretions and excretions.
Examples of infections/conditions that require contact precautions: Salmonella, scabies, Shigella, and pressure ulcers.
In addition to standard precautions:

Wear a gown and gloves upon room entry of a patient/resident on contact precautions.
Use disposable single-use or patient/resident-dedicated noncritical care equipment (such as blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes).


For certain organisms likely to have spores (like Clostridium difficile) and some disease with ongoing transmission (like Norovirus), “special” contact precautions are needed. In addition to the measures above, perform hand hygiene using soap and water and consider use of a hypochlorite solution (e.g., bleach) for environmental cleaning.

Droplet Precautions

Used for patients/residents that have an infection that can be spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions.
Examples of infections/conditions that require droplet precautions:  influenza, N. meningitidis (one of the causes of meningitis), pertussis (also known as “whooping cough”), and rhinovirus (also known as the “common cold”).
 In addition to standard precautions:

Wear a mask upon room entry of a patient/resident on droplet precautions.


A single patient/resident room is preferred. If not available, spatial separation of more than 3 feet and drawing the curtain between beds is especially important.
Patients/residents on droplet precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette.

Airborne Precautions

Used for patients/residents that have an infection that can be spread over long distances when suspended in the air. These disease particles are very small and require special respiratory protection and room ventilation.
Examples of infections/conditions that require airborne precautions: chickenpox, measles, and tuberculosis.
In addition to standard precautions:

Wear amask or respiratorprior to room entry, depending on thedisease-specific recommendations. Most diseases will require N95 or higher respiratory protection.
Place patient/resident in an airborne infection isolation (AII) room – a single-person room that is equipped with special air handing and ventilation capacity.

If the facility does not have an AII room, place the person in a private room with the door closed until the person is transferred to another facility with an AII room.




When possible, non-immune healthcare workers should not care for patients/residents with vaccine preventable airborne diseases (like measles and chickenpox).

And, lemme see, one of the W African countries originally hosting the outbreak asked the US military to halt their "experiments"
And, oh my, "they' have yet (although some have stopped but not all) to halt all flights between the highly infected areas to DENSELY populated areas...
And some little research company in SoCal just happens to have a vaccine antidote for this mutation of the virus, meaning that they already had a live strand or two of said virus so they could make the vaccine.....

That's interesting. Here's something else to ponder. Rachel Maddow on MSNBC had a snippet on the very "coffins" we speak of. This clip "was" on youtube, but has since been scrubbed. Wonder why? It's getting very difficult to tell truth from fiction.
Here's another example: This book was recommended to me today by the friend that sent the refractometer to the back to eden creator. In researching the author who's a Vet & has done autopsies on folks, I ran across this, which in turn led me to look up the author of that article, to find this , then this and finally this.
All I can say is WTF, whata rabbit hole! I will err on the side of the vet who's minimum knowledge is within the realm of 5 species with the knowledge of animal husbandry and the importance of mineralizing your livestock.

Silly wabbit. The chart is NOT hyperbole because, if anything, we'll not know the real numbers ever. There are numerous "goat paths" throughout all these African countries that are travelled freely without showing a passport. They (the people) will move around and not be properly counted, especially in the more rural areas. 
There is ONLY one way to stop this virus and that is to cordone off about seven African countries; no movement in and no movement out, until it burns itself out. Recall, they have Never seen multiple patients with ebola...ever before...in the large cities like Lagos. Recall, only fity percent of those living in Lagos (Nigeria the most westernized of the African countries, except for perhaps South Africa) have running water, and that water isn't necessarly "clean" water. 
CDC ran a cute little computer program a few years ago (disguised, of course) for the gamer community. They wanted to see what would happen in a "zombie game" with a cordoned off area. Course it was a melee with all kinds of people breaking out until the borders of the cordoned off area fell completely. 
Now our friends in England have decided that they can do experiments outside of a controlled laboratory: http://news.yahoo.com/wanted-60-volunteers-test-ebola-vaccine-middle-eng...
Guy wants sixty volunteers to test the ebola "vaccine." Course it is supposed to be a vaccine without any live virus (chortle) but factor in the nature-wants-to-win thingy and that sucker could come roaring back to life in one of those sixty and we are off to the races. 
First principle of life: Never trust anyone. 2nd principle of life: Never ever trust the head of the CDC. Tom FRieden is the idjat head of the CDC. Not long ago he said something (can't find the exact quote but this is accurate) like, "well we don't do that kind of thing anymore" as he was addressing cordoning off the areas that have ebola.
Now when the head of the CDC is so stupid that he applies politically correct attitudes towards the most lethal virus on the planet, he should be fired, not immediately, but yesterday would be too soon.
A CDC which has allowed in leprosy patients to the US, who then refuse to show up for treatment because of the "stigma" is a CDC that is too stupid to be giving advice to Africa about ebola. And which is a CDC that allows gay males to continue to have random sex even as 50,000 NEW Aids cases strains our health care system each year along with all the other (drug-reisstant gonnorhea) stds that gays are particularly prone to getting from each other.
Ya know the thing about viruses like this to be feared? They got nothing to do but crop up in new and frightening ways. LIke the American missionary who was "cured" except that you shouldn't have sex for two months because maybe you could pass it on. Or if that's the case Then why can't it crop up again in the saliva or sweat. Interestingly enough, malaria is like that too. You think it's gone and then it comes back again and again. Something about these bugs cured in the crucible of African heat. They just don't stop.
Now go watch 28 Days Later or Outbreak.

The Sahara reporter news broke the story before the Nigerian government made the announcement yesterday of how one of the original guys - Sawyer's - contacts made it to Port Harcourt, Nigeria. He was treated by a doctor who died last Friday. The doctor ran a hospital and treated this contact in a hotel secretly. The doctor's wife is now in quarantine - suspected of also having Ebola

Thanks for that heads-up.
So a doctor, who was treating a diplomat that contracted Ebola from Patrick Sawyer, died on Friday.
His wife is sick, likely from Ebola, and under observation.
The diplomat is, for some reason, still alive.
EDIT: And an additional 70 people, all secondary contacts, are currently under observation while the doctor's hospital has been closed and the hotel which was used for treatment also is closed.
This confirms the virus is (i) highly virulent, and (ii) capable of spreading itself into urban areas. In case you still weren't quite sure.







Thu, 08/28/2014 - 14:15 | 5154892
Alea Iactaest





And as for secondary contacts all being identified, the WHO stated earlier this week that they are grossly under-staffed for contact tracing. In one location they've successfully identified 200 of an estimated 2,000 contacts.
 
If WHO is stating "20,000" cases then they know that is coming. The goal currently is to manage this in a way that tbe public doesn't come unhinged right now. Imagine Ferguson, MO playing out in every city as the FSA decides there's no downside. Actually, the lack of violence (aside from Mr. Brown) will make Fergie look like a walk in the park.

Contact tracing's dubious anyway.  So one of these guys gets up in the morning, in NYC or Mumbai, or London feeling shitty, about 21 days after returning from Africa, but hops on the subway or the bus or whatever anyway, sneezes a couple of times, wipes his nose, grabs the door or the seat or whatever to keep from falling, rides the elevator and sneezes again, then later that day feels so bad he checks into the hospital and gets quarantined.  I wonder how the 'contact tracing' works in this scenario?
