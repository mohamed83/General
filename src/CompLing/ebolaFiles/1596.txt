ATLANTA --  An Atlanta hospital says a patient infected with Ebola will be brought from West Africa to its isolation unit for treatment.
Emory University Hospital says the patient is expected to arrive Tuesday morning.
Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. James Wilson says the patient would be flown into Dobbins Air Reserve Base outside Atlanta.
The hospital released no more information on the patient.
The World Health Organization, however, says a doctor who has been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the disease. It says the doctor is in Freetown and will be evacuated.
Two aid workers who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia were treated successfully last month at Emory. A third patient is being treated in Nebraska.
