Possible Ebola Case Being Treated in Miami Hospital UPDATED

Categories:     News



























A potential case of ebola is being treated at a Miami-area hospital. NBC Miami has confirmed that news with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but little else is known at this time. 
The patient's name and background and the specific hospital where he or she is being treated have not yet been released.

Update: Jackson Memorial Hospital tweeted that it had a patient who was suspected of having ebola last week but that the patient tested negative. It's unclear if this is the same case. 
No #Ebola at @jacksonhealth. Patient tested negative last week. Every precaution was taken. All agencies worked well in partnership.— Jackson Miracles (@JacksonMiracles) September 8, 2014

_______
The largest ebola breakout in history began last December in West Africa. Three U.S. aid workers contracted the disease while working there and were flown home and treated in American hospitals. Two were cured, but another remains hospitalized. 
Scientists believe it's only a matter of time until an infected patient caries the virus to another continent through air travel. 
Several scares have occurred, but no such case has yet been confirmed in the States.
The CDC stresses that although ebola is highly contagious, it's transmitted only through contact with bodily fluids such as blood. In American hospitals, doctors believe they can contain the disease effectively.

Sorry, but it is unconscionable for our government to allow anyone who's traveled through, or lived in West Africa to enter the US.  ANYONE.We have no effective treatment for the disease.  It kills about 80% of the people It infects.  Our government needs to treat this seriously, but what do we expect from the president who wants to transform America, and who wants to play golf more than do his freaking job. One little piece of irony - if this gets loose in the population, it'll be a Blue State disease - where there are more immigrants, is more densely populated, etc.But God help us all if this gets out into the general public...

"The CDC stresses that while Ebola is highly contagious, it's transmitted only through bodily contact with fluids like blood. In American hospitals, doctors believe they can contain the disease effectively." The scary and operative word in the above sentence is " believe". Scary indeed.

fact don't matter when you can make shit up miami news timesA patient in Miami who was suspected of contracting Ebola has tested negative for the virus, a Florida hospital system said. The
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct additional 
testing to confirm the result, a spokesman said on a conference call 
Monday, but the patient is considered to be a "low risk."Last 
week, a Jackson Health System patient tested negative for the Ebola 
virus," Matthew Pinzur, a spokesman for the health system said in a statement.
 "The patient had shown some symptoms associated with the disease and 
was tested in an abundance of caution. All of our community's 
precautionary measures were taken, multiple agencies worked effectively 
in partnership, and we demonstrated that we are ready in the unlikely 
event that this disease is detected in Miami-Dade County."
