There are still critical shortages of Ebola treatment centre beds in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the three countries that have intense and widespread transmission. In the past week, an additional 40 beds have been established by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Monrovia; a further 40 beds will soon be available in Bong, Liberia. Total Ebola Treatment Centre bed capacity for these three countries are: Guinea, 130; Liberia, 314; and Sierra Leone, 130. Another 170 beds are expected to be available soon in Sierra Leone. Based on current capacity and needs, an additional 980 Ebola treatment centre beds are required, with 760 of these in Monrovia alone. Although plans are in place to build such facilities, there are challenges related to site selection as well as a critical shortage of clinical teams available to manage these facilities. MSF and Ministries of Health are being supported by WHO to resolve these issues.Laboratory capacity is gradually expanding; however, there are still critical needs in a number of locations. Increased laboratory capacity is essential for proper screening and triage of patients.
