Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have failed to impose such steos, allowing the disease to take hold.The announcement came as Nigerian students prepared to return to school after an enforced summer break because of Ebola.However, the WHO said the world’s worst outbreak of the virus remained a “public health emergency of international concern.”The WHO, also said a total of 5,864 people had been infected in five west African countries as of September 18, and had claimed 181 lives since the last death toll of 2,630 was issued on September 14.Guinea, where the outbreak began at the start of the year, and neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone by far account for most of the cases and continue to see ballooning numbers.Liberia had been hit hardest, with 1,578 deaths from 3,022 cases.The spread of the disease has threatened to undo progress made in rebuilding Liberia and Sierra Leone after their wars of the 1990s, and exposed the fragility of the state in Guinea.﻿Emperor Cruz Badwenba Francis's photos1Add a comment...
