August 16, 2014  by Bukola Adebayo  


The first female doctor to be infected with the Ebola Virus Disease, has been discharged from the quarantine unit of the Emergency Operation Centre of the Mainland Hospital, Yaba, Lagos State.
The Minister of Health, Prof Onyebuchi Chukwu, who disclosed this at a press briefing in Lagos on Saturday, said the female doctor was one of the doctors that had primary contact with the late American-Liberian ‎Patrick Sawyer, who died of the Ebola Virus Disease in Lagos.
Chukwu, who was accompanied by the Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Dr Jide Idris, said the discharged patient had been given a clean bill of health by experts managing confirmed cases.
According to them, she is the first patient to have survived the deadly disease in Nigeria.
Chukwu said, “The EOC has advised me to announce that the first ‎Nigerian to have been confirmed to have the Ebola virus disease has this evening been discharged from the isolation unit at the Mainland Hospital, Lagos.
“I have consulted with the experts, and they say clearly that there is a discharge protocol that was employed for this particular patient. It has been followed strictly and was concluded today‎ and what you are getting now is the final outcome.
“Ordinarily if she had been afflicted with another illness she would have been discharged long before now.”
The minister stated that the health of the other five patients in isolation was improving.
“The total number of confirmed cases of EVD in the country is now 12, with four deaths and 189 under surveillance in Lagos and six in Enugu,” he said.
Responding to queries concerning the welfare of the Ebola victims under the care of the response team at the EOC , he allayed such fears regarding the standard and quality of care.
He said, “As you are aware, the patients under treatment have now been moved to the new 40-bed capacity isolation ward provided by the Lagos State Government. Additional equipment has also been made available to the new isolation ward by the Federal Government.”
On the controversy surrounding the use of some experimental Ebola drugs ‎being proposed for adoption by the Federal Government, he said the drug failed to meet the requirements for approval.
He said, “You will recall that last Thursday. I announced that we were ready to deploy an experimental drug, Nano Silver.
“Although the drug has since last Thursday been made available to the EOC in Lagos. It has not been administered to any patient because we were awaiting clearance by ‎the National Health Research Ethics Committee.
“I regret to inform you that the drug did not meet the requirements of the committee.”
He, however, said other drugs were being evaluated by the Treatment Research Group for EVD.
He also debunked rumours of EDV in Imo, Abia and Cross River states but noted that the case of the disease in Kwara was still under investigation.
”The mother of the child in Kwara tested negative and we are still investigating the child. Also, the case of the corpse in Anambra was already embalmed and we are waiting for the test result.
”All the mortuary attendants who had contact with the corpse tested negative. So, there is no need to panic,” he said.
On the suspension of residency training in federal health institutions, he said there had been problems with the training which also informed the ongoing doctors’ strike.
He said, “The suspension is with all Federal Government hospitals, state teaching hospitals are not affected.
”The government suspended the training to allow for critical investigation and come up with better ways to improve the training.”
Chukwu noted that the paper work for the life insurance cover for volunteers was ongoing and that the Lagos State Government had started the implementation of the insurance cover for its health workers.

Heck



Hmmm






mac



Thank God,whosoever the lord has set free is free indeed






Guest



“Chukwu said eight persons were still alive”. I ask myself does he want them to die before? What an insensitive language from a Minister of Health






Cypo



Sorry Mr, I suggest you go back and read the Press Briefing again and maybe, and I say maybe you will understand it better. There is no place in the statement where the Minister used that statement you are talking about. I guess you had wrong comprehension of the text.








siddonlook



This is a gross mistake by the health authorities.








Ajodo



Miracle working Jesus!  He will always show why He was, is and is to come. The beginning and the end! 






Okay



May the rest of them be healed in Jesus name.God is good.






siddonlook



Thank God, but I believe this is a gross mistake by the health authorities.
If the Americans who were afflicted before she was have not been discharged till now how come we are discharging ours in less than two weeks ?
Something is wrong somewhere ?






ken



Has been discharged not from hospital but from quarantine.






African



Experimentation in Africa,Only God can help us.






Ogbonigboru



One of the foreign doctors who was really afflicted is in the process of being discharged but our doctor here in Nigeria has not been discharged from the hospital but has been moved from the isolation or quarantine ward to another place within the hospital. Blame Punch for the misuse of Words.






siddonlook



Thank you for the clarification.










Richy Amechi Fidel



Nano Silva is allow drug and cannot cure Ebola or fight the virus, this drug is used to treat Gonorrhea.






leksman101



Have you had one before ? How do you know?






Richy Amechi Fidel



I bought it sometime ago in India while I was living there, it’s for treatment of bacteria and cannot stand ebola.










AMA



Good news! I can now go and enjoy myself at the club.My Nigerian Brothers & Sisters Please Rejoice.God who started this work must finish it.






don power



Thank God and shame to apc who import the VIRUS!






Adebayo



you mean Ebola Tinubu?
lol








Omooba Adekunle Orafidiya



Really? Perhaps, she was misdiagnosed in the first instance.  We Nigerians are notorious for our carelessness and incompetence in matters of this nature.






kjbmajesty



Too Good 2 be true! 






Marcus Osagie Ogbeibu



Can the minister tell us the secret behind their healings! He only said one was healed and discharged but failed to tell us the drug used






obi kendo



marcus they came to our church last two sunday ago,and we gave them what God give us  for his children,and you will soon know brothet.








Okache



A great news indeed. We thank God for this wonderful news. Others will also walk out alive. We salute the doctors and nurses attending to our fellow country men and women. May God continue to protect them. Well done brave doctors and nurses.






Nate



I only wish and pray this is true. The fact remains that this minister can’t be trusted. We will not forget the bogus claims he made at his last conference only a few hours before the nurse died. We are watching. 






GBenga



Thank you the minister and Lagos state Commissioner for the collaborative job since the beginning of this crisis. This is how governance run.
In addition, kudos to our health workers in the hospitals wherever these patients are. It takes courage to be doing the great jobs.
THANK YOU.






siddonlook



This people have started playing politics with this disease again …. 
The Americans who were afflicted with it have not been discharged even with the best medical facilities and staff and you discharged ours in less than 2 weeks … 
Man, una dey joke with people life … 






ifebuche



Can go and get infected let’s test? 








chiedoziee harrimann



We like to know how did she get healed or treated? What was done differently? Nigerians we have the right to ask questions. 






Aloysius Maduforo RD



The God Almighty has done it. Our prayers were not in vain that’s why many are surprise because when you call the name of Jesus against anythingHe will always ssurprise you. To God be the glory. I salute the courage of all health workers for their passion and dedication to serve the nationa. My God will bless all of you and provide a helper to you when you need it in Jesus Name!
