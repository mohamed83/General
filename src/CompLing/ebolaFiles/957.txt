REVEALED: The World’s MOST DEADLY Epidemic Is Not #Ebola, It IS THIS (CLICK)

By WhatsUpAfrica on August 25, 2014













File Photo

The spread of Ebola across West Africa is sad and shocking, but there’s something far worse going on according to Ikenna Azuike. And that’s how fast the BLAME for the disease is spreading. And whilst everyone focuses on blaming one another, the virus continues to ravage the region. For the latest on the epidemic though, have a listen to Versa Chi Chi (aka Mollie Balogun) – What’s Up Africa’s West African correspondent!
What’s Up Africa is a video blog created and presented by Ikenna Azuike, filmed and edited by Sandesh Bhugaloo and Dominic Soete and written by Ikenna Azuike, Ernest Bazanye and Mollie Balogun. New episodes are published on Fridays.
