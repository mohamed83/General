Acknowledgments
Capital for Good would like to extend our gratitude to the Legatum Foundation for providing the initial support to launch the Ebola Crisis Fund.
Legatum Foundation
The Legatum Foundation is a founding donor of the Ebola Crisis Fund. The Legatum Foundation is the development arm of the Legatum Group, a multi-billion dollar investment firm. Drawing on Legatum’s investment heritage, the Foundation allocates capital at the bottom of the Prosperity Ladder™ to projects, people, and ideas that create enduring prosperity. The Legatum Foundation invests in projects to help the most disadvantaged in society. For over a decade, the Foundation has funded more than 1,400 organizations throughout the developing world, impacting over 64 million lives. Examples include investing to eradicate Neglected Tropical Diseases through the END Fund, end slavery through the Freedom Fund, and help children get back to school through Speed Schools in Africa. The Foundation has a preference towards funding local, community based organizations, where in many cases, a modest grant produces an outsized impact.
