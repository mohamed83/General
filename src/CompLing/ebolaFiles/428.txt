A Must Have In Every Woman's HandBag 






#Fashion






I know that the guys/men will be feeling left out by this blog post, so before I start, I will love to say, dear guys/men you can read (in case you missed it)/ re-read this post >>>chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/07/a-  on A Must Have In Every Man's Closest and feel inspired to dress, look and feel like a King that you are. 



Back to today's post. As earlier posted on Where To Apply For A Long Lasting Smell >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/06/where-to-apply-perfume-for-long-lasting.html?spref=tw … and also on A Must Have In Every Woman's Closest >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/07/a-must-have-in-every-womans-closet.html?spref=tw … a lady's outfit is incomplete without her perfume. But do you know that a lady/woman looks bare or naked without her handbag? A lady/woman's handbag is a very important accessory to her and she of course never jokes with them. 



Now that this has been said, join me as we find out ''A Must Have In Every Woman's Handbag'' I hope you get inspired. 



1) Lip gloss-

A lady/woman never jokes with her lip gloss and this is also to help keep her lips hydrated.

2) A small perfume- You can find more on the above link titled Where To Apply For A Long Lasting Smell 



3) Hand cream- To keep your hands moisturised during the day/ after washing your hands.  



4) Handkerchief



5) Mint chewing gum - The importance of this cannot be overemphasised. This helps freshen your breathe. Not that you are to chew it till you get to your destination. It is not lady like. You are to have it in your mouth for about 30 mins or less and throw it away when you are almost getting to your destination.

A Letter To My Teenage Self






#Inspiration






Dear Teenage Me, 



This is a letter I have decided to write to you after many years of you moving out of the teenage stage. This is a letter of what I would have done if I knew what I knew now. This is a letter, I am writing is what I would have told my teenage self... I hope this letter inspires other teenage girls out there. 



God- I see you are always studying your bible. I see you are always praying. I see you are always being cautious not to offend God. You have been given lots of bad names about it. Please do not mind the naysayers. Please hold onto God cos as you get older, God will open your eyes to things you never imagined you would have seen on your own. He will also be teaching you things that you never thought you would ever learn. You will fall more in love with God, though there are times you will feel as though God doesn't love you. But as you go on, you will discover that, God loves you more than you ever thought you will be loved and you will realise why what happened, happened. God is just making you discover yourself and Him more. So my darling, please hold onto God real tight, just never ever let Him go









Boys & Sex-





At this age, everyone (teenagers)  wants to grow up so fast or they will believe that they are now adults. It is at this stage/age that you will meet all manner of boys. Those that care about you and will want to be great  friends with you and those that all they want is to sleep with you. My dear teenage me, the sad part of it is that, the ones that only pretend that they care, only to get what they want are usually more than those who care. So you need to be extremely careful, vigilant and cautious. Always ask God to reveal to you those guys whose intentions and missions are nothing but evil... don't worry, I see God directing your ways and path. 

Also my dear, having sex with a guy before you are married, strains your relationship with God and moves God away from you... You can find more about that here on an article written by Ibukun Oniwide >>> http://chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/09/friday-inspirations-tips-on-love-and.html?spref=tw … So my dear, please continue to keep yourself...



Parents-





 I see you trying to be an adult even before you become one. I see you believing that you know everything and don't want to be corrected. I see you arguing with your parents a lot and after every argument, I see you go to your room, staying behind the door or on your bed and just crying, regretting every argument you had with your parents. OH DEAR TEENAGE ME!

I will advice you to please stop arguing with your parents, they know better. They are way smarter and wiser than you, to mislead you. They love you more than you ever believe. They are angels sent from God to you in form of parents.

Friday Inspirations- SALVATION! By @CameronCelina






#FridayInspirations




Welcome back @CameronCelina ! We are pleased to have you back! @CameronCelina shared with us ealier a great inspiring post titled ''CONFIDENCE: The best accessory a human can ever'' Please find more about it here >>>  chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/04/friday-inspirations-confidence-best.html?spref=tw … 

Today, @CameronCelina will be sharing with us an inspiring article on SALVATION! Enjoy!


We keep hearing
the word ‘’salvation’’ but we really don’t know what exactly it means and what
we could acquire from it. 



According to
the dictionary ‘’salvation is being saved
or protected from harm or being saved or delivered from some dire situation’’.
In religion, ‘’salvation is stated as the
saving of the soul from sin and its consequences’’.



But to my
own understanding salvation is like a key to enter into the kingdom of heaven,
to be saved, freedom from the power of sin. In this way you are saved for
eternal life. You are no longer lost in sin.





And what is
this sin?



Sin is   an immoral act considered to
be a transgression against divine law. Whereby going against the
rules\commandments\laws of the most high GOD. 



As we all know that JESUS the son of GOD came to the world
to die for our sins and wash away our transgressions… but only those who
believe in this would have eternal life (John 3:16).

Different  Colours Of Roses And Their Meanings






#Discoveries

According to the Oxford Dictionary, A rose is ''a prickly bush or shrub that
typically bears red, pink, yellow, or white fragrant flowers, native to north
temperate regions and widely grown as an ornamental.




Genus Rosa, family Rosaceae (the
rose family); many species, hybrids, and cultivars. This large family includes
most temperate fruits (apple, plum, peach, cherry, blackberry, strawberry) as
well as the hawthorns, rowans, and potentillas''.

Now that we have know a little history coupled with the meaning of rose flower/flowers, rose flowers are a beauty to behold. Rose flowers are a work of art created by God Almighty. In fact, everything created by God are a work of art as we have being seeing (Kindly find out more about God's creations by searching this blog with the hash-tag #Discoveries . It is just so awesome to love and appreciate the beauty in God's creations. God indeed is an awesome God! God works in mysterious ways. He is indeed the greatest artist and architect ever...

This post is aimed at inspiring you and me to know the meanings of the rose flowers we buy for our loved ones or for people as a whole. Cos if we happen to buy a particular colour of rose flower for someone and do not know the meaning, we are actually sending the wrong message to that person without us knowing. I hope you get inspired by the different colours of rose flowers created by God and their meanings. ENJOY!

Thanks to this website- http://www.rkdn.org/ I was able to know the meanings of the different colours of rose flowers created by God.



White Roses means Purity, Humility, ''I am worthy of you'', Secrecy...





White Bridal Roses means Happy love




White and Red Roses means Unity

Colour Combinations- Episode 2: Red And Blue






#Fashion

Before I start, I will love to say that it will not be right if I just go ahead and blog without first apologising. I would love to apologise for bringing the episode 2 of colour combination so late. However, I hope you loved and were inspired by my other fashion posts? *Hugs*

P.S- Kindly find here >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/03/colour-combinations-episode-1.html?spref=tw …  Colour Combinations- Episode 1 in case you missed it.

In Episode 1, I talked about colour combination ideas but in Episode 2, I will try and bring those ideas into life with pictures. If you follow my blog posts well, you will notice that I am a HUGE FAN of colours particularly bright colours... colour blocking... a pop of colour (here >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/07/making-big-difference-with-pop-of-colour.html?spref=tw … is a post on Making A Huge Difference With A Pop Of Colour in case you missed it) and the list goes on and on. To find our more about my previous fashion blog posts, please do search this blog with the hashtag #Fashion

Please do note that red and blue colour combinations was not included in Episode 1. 

I am very sure that as some guys/men read this post, they will be saying ''well... sorry, but I cannot and will not colour block or combine colours, it is so not manly of me''. Well... I will love to say that, Kings colour block and also combine colours. If in doubt, you can find the post on ''Who Says Men Cannot Colour Block?''  here >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/05/who-said-men-cannot-colour-block.html?spref=tw …)

The Unexpected Visit... RAPTURE!!!






#Inspiration






It is funny or should I say sad that many do not believe that Jesus exist neither do they believe that He is real. It is funny that many hate the mere mention of the name of Jesus. It is funny that may fail to believe that Jesus came to earth to die for the sins of the world so that we can be reconciled back to God, The Father. It is also very sad/unfortunate that many believe that Jesus isn't coming back to take His children to Heaven with Him (this means RAPTURE).



Many are of the opinion that, it is being like forever that they kept hearing that Jesus is coming but He is yet to come and has stopped believing that He is coming back (The Second Coming). But need I say that, a thousand years is like a day in the eyes of God (Psalm 90:4). So if a thousand years is like a day in God's eyes, what will 10 thousand years be to God? 10 days right? Please don't be misled, misguided or deceived.



RAPTURE is the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ to earth, this time as earlier mentioned to take His children with Him to Heaven away from this sinful world. The first coming of Jesus was when He was born into this earth as a human (Matthew 1, 2 and Luke 1,2). Jesus was born into this earth as a human cos that is the only way He could sacrifice His life for the sins of we humans and for Him to reconcile we humans back to God. Before the birth of Jesus, people stopped hearing from God and there was a great distance/gap between man and God cos of our sins. Remember that God is a Holy God, so Jesus came to bridge this distance/gap from man to God and the only way He could do that was to sacrifice His life for us... the greatest sacrifice anyone could ever do... do give your life for someone.       

Like Jesus said, He will come when no one least expected His coming (Matthew 24:30-31). Just like a thief doesn't announce his coming. Matthew 24 (please do try to read this passage) talks in-depth about the things that will happen before the second coming of Jesus. And as funny as it may sound, almost all if not all the things that Matthew 24 talked about are ALL coming to pass/happening.

Friday Inspirations- Continuation Of Tips On Love And Relationship By Ibukun Oniwinde 






#FridaypInspirations






Cont'd from Last week's article (Here >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/09/friday-inspirations-tips-on-love-and.html?spref=tw … is last week's article in case you missed it). 


These days Marriages are no longer respected..broken homes and broken hearts..terrible up bringing and this has affected our society, there is so much moral decadence everywhere, it all starts from the choices we make

Will you be proud to have a son that is exactly like him?

The society is in despair..young men are deliquent because there is no one to truly look up to, No father figure, No Hero! Married men are sleeping with young girls, committing fraud in their organisations, some are drunkards, woman beaters, irresponsible..who will the young men look up to?? Who will your son look up to?

A faithful man who can find?

That he buys you gifts,takes you round the world and somersaults for you is not the issue, any man can do that.

Men take women abroad, spend lots of money on them even without loving them. A man can give even without Loving

Is He faithful to his words? Is he a man of integrity (words and action)?

Is he trustworthy, does he take responsibility for his conducts or does he push blames?

Does He Love God? Run away from a man who will disobey God's word without thinking....even if he speaks in tongues
Does he Love God? Is he sold out to God

Does He pay his tithe...The devourer will always come, but God will only rebuke the devourer from the man and his family who are committed in tithing.

The Unbelievable Wonders Of SHEA BUTTER






#Lifestyle



I have being hearing a lot, when I say a lot I mean a lot about this butter/cream called  Shea Butter. Until, someone dear to me made shea butter her new hair cream and within the space of 3 months, her hair became unimaginably long. I was in shock and of course speechless. This person's hair has ''been trying'' to grow for years and just within the space of 3 months became so long.
Also, I know of someone who was having serious body pains and the mere massaging of Shea butter just made the pains stop. Same goes for another person I know who had serious facial infections and the continuous applying of shea butter for 7 days (a week) made this person's face look like that of a baby, in terms of smoothness. These are just a few of the many things I have heard about Shea butter. I was left with no choice than to research more about this butter/cream called Shea butter.

P.S- I used the words butter or cream cos it can be eaten or licked or it can be used as a body or hair or massage cream.

My research findings...
According to naturepurity.com Shea Butter from comes from nuts of Shea trees and these trees are found in the Savannah area of West Africa. The English name Shea comes from its Bambara name ''sii'', which means sacred. This sacred tree grows up to 60 feet tall and was planted does not germinate till the next 20  years and lives (after germination/growing) for the next 200 years. Shea nuts are traditionally harvested by women, crushed and boiled to extract the Shea butter, which has its unconditional aficionados all over the world.

Below are some of the unbelievable wonders of SHEA BUTTER-
- Do you know that Shea butter helps remove stretch marks?
- Do you know that Shea butter helps in making ones hair soft, long and full?
-  Do you know that Shea butter moisturises the skin, thereby giving the skin enough Vitamin A, E and F?
- Do you know that Shea butter is a great moisturising cream for babies delicate and sensitive skin? 
- Do you know that Shea butter serves as an anti-ageing agent thereby taking away every unwanted wrinkles from your face and body?

The Mystery Behind Rainbows 








#Discoveries






Rainbows are unique and beautiful works of art created by God. Rainbows occasionally appears on the sky after it finish raining. Why the word ''occasionally'' was used is because, rainbows are not seen on the sky often. They are unique, beautiful and really mind-blowing.  The one of the mysteries to rainbows is that, no one knows where they start from and where it actually ends. There is just this excitement, this unexplainable joy that naturally comes into the minds and hearts of people whenever they see a rainbow/rainbows.

According to Wikipedia,  A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that is caused by both reflection and refraction of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of amulticoloured arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun.

Now let's find out exactly what a rainbow is and how a rainbow came into existence. To find this out, we need to go back into history by opening the book of Genesis Chapter 9 vs 8- 17



''8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:





13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.

Looking Like Royalty On Black And White- Part 2: Men  






#Fashion

Today, we will be continuing black and white inspiration series we began yesterday. Yesterday was for the ladies while today will be for men and home designs.
Remember this blog is all about inspiring men to look and feel kings, you can find more on that here >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/04/dress-look-and-feel-like-king.html?spref=tw … But please don't forget that there are certain things a king, that is you, should not be found wearing. You can find more on that here >>> http://chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/05/mens-fashion-faux-pas-mens-fashion-donts.html?spref=tw … Today's post is all about looking like royalty on black and white. Considering the fact that I am not a huge fan of white, I am not disputing the fact that white is a unique colour which by the way happens to really really look good on men. After yesterday's post, I am beginning to change my mind on white.

We earlier talked about making a huge difference with a pop of colour >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/07/making-big-difference-with-pop-of-colour.html?spref=tw …  you can find that here in case you missed it, how a pop of colour makes you stand out any time and anywhere you find yourself. This post is not to make you stop popping your outfit with bright colours but also to inspire you to look like royalty, to look like kings just with these 2 unique colours : black and white.

Below are pictures of men, looking charming, looking like royalty above all, looking and feeling like kings on black and white. Enjoy And Be Inspired!

Looking Like Royalty On Black And White- Part 1: Ladies






#Fashion

Before I start, I will love to say that in as much as I am the one blogging, this topic happens to also be a great inspiration for me. I am also going to get inspired from combining your outfit so well just with black and white. This is because I am not a huge fan of white and because I am crazy about combining colours or popping your outfit with a bright colour (You can find more on making a huge difference with a pop of colour here >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/07/making-big-difference-with-pop-of-colour.html?spref=tw … in case you missed it).
So, this topic will be an inspiration for people including me that one can actually look like royalty just by combining your black and white outfit well.

P.S- But remember ladies, that has a lady you should not be found wearing any of the following, fashion wise that is  >>>  chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/06/womens-fashion-faux-pas-womens-fashion.html?spref=tw …

This topic will be divided into 3:
- Part 1- Ladies
- Part 2- Men
- Part 3- Home designs i.e. designing your home with just black and white colours and still leaving your home looking like a royals home.

So dear readers, please don't miss this series,
Monday, that's today will be for the ladies and
Tuesday, will be for men and homes... all black and white inspiration.

Below are pictures of ladies, all on black and white and they all look classy, beautiful, chic, sophisticated and above all, like royalty. Enjoy!

Smile Beautiful! Smile Handsome!






#Inspiration




Smile happens to be a general mask sometimes worn by many. Why did I say sometimes? Because, sometimes, people are genuinely smiling while other times, people use smile to cover their pain, their hidden tears, their troubles, their affliction, their trials, their sorrows etc. A mask in the sense that, you can be looking at someone who is smiling or being joyful but deep down, the person is neither happy nor joyful.

No matter what you are going through beautiful people, please put a smile on your face. Please smile anyway. People seeing your tears or pains is alright... it's being said that a problem shared is half solved. However, people seeing your smile is the best and priceless.

Smiling automatically changes your sorrowful countenance. Smiling helps relieve your pain for the moment. Smiling brings joyful people and joyful things your way. Smiling lightens the room you are and it attracts a positive vibe and atmosphere. Smiling makes God look down upon you and show you mercy, thereby turning your sorrow into joy. You smiling frightens the devil off. Because, despite all the devil tried to do or bring your way, you are still smiling, you still have a reason to smile or you chose to smile. So beautiful people, please SMILE.

What the devil hates most is seeing you joyful, happy or smiling. So smile and put the devil to shame. Give yourself a reason to smile. Pause and take a moment to think of all the reasons why you need to smile.

-Smile cos God has given you a second chance. A second chance to live. A second chance to see a brand new day. A second chance to smell nature. A second chance to feel the breeze, watch the sun rise and set. A second chance to feel the sun or the rain or watch the rain or snow fall. A second chance to walk under the snow.
Just like a previous post, smile cos Life Is Beautiful! You can find more about the post here >>> chidinmainspirations.blogspot.com/2014/09/life-is-beautiful.html?spref=tw …

- Smile cos you are alive.
-  Smile cos you can see.
