FDA Moves On Tekmira's Ebola Drug While Sarepta's Sits Unused

The treatment of the two Ebola-stricken, American medical missionaries with the well-documented, ZMapp “plantibodies” drug developed by U.S. and Canadian companies and federal agencies has raised questions of bioethics and process.
But how can Ebola drugs be tested for efficacy if their use is restricted during the most widespread Ebola outbreak since 1976?
As a result, the World Health Organization has scheduled a meeting of medical ethicists for next week how drugs not previously tested in humans might be ethically mobilized during such a crisis. From the WHO announcement: 

“We are in an unusual situation in this outbreak. We have a disease with a high fatality rate without any proven treatment or vaccine,” says Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, Assistant Director-General at the World Health Organization. “We need to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on what the responsible thing to do is.”

To recap, the ZMapp combination product of three, humanized antibodies against different parts of the Ebolavirus outer glycoprotein – which continues to be called a “secret serum” – was given to Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol prior to their medivac journey from a hospital in Paynesville, Liberia, to the biosafety level-4 isolation ward in Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital.
In her deeply-considered article yesterday, Laura Seay at The Washington Post wrote,

“The optics of the situation were already bad enough: at great expense, two white Americans were whisked away to safety and a level of health care that simply cannot be provided on the fly in a Liberian hospital. The black Liberians they had been treating were left to see whether fate would save or kill them under the same substandard health care system they have always lived under.”
“That what now looks like a miracle cure was only given to the white Americans looks even worse. Why hadn’t anyone reached out to try the serum on Ebola patients sooner, especially if its potential to heal is so promising?”

However, this antibody combination had never been given to humans, not even healthy volunteers.

Other drugs already in Phase 1 safety trials
In contrast, at least two other companies have products that have already been subject to Phase 1 safety trials. Most widely publicized has been TKM-Ebola, a lipid nanoparticle, RNA-interference drug being developed by Vancouver-based, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, together with a division of the Department of Defense.
Single-dose and multiple ascending dose studies have been progressing and the company announced on July 21 that the FDA was placing a hold on the trials as they conducted an interim analysis of the drug’s safety profile.
However, Tekmira just announced today that the FDA verbally confirmed the modification of the trials’ status to a “partial hold,” thereby allowing the drug to be used in people infected with Ebola.

“We are pleased that the FDA has considered the risk-reward of TKM-Ebola for infected patients. We have been closely watching the Ebola virus outbreak and its consequences, and we are willing to assist with any responsible use of TKM-Ebola. The foresight shown by the FDA removes one potential roadblock to doing so,” said Dr. Mark Murray, CEO and President, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals. “This current outbreak underscores the critical need for effective therapeutic agents to treat the Ebola virus. We recognize the heightened urgency of this situation, and are carefully evaluating options for use of our investigational drug within accepted clinical and regulatory protocols.”

The Tekmira drug targets three of the seven genes of the Ebola virus. (Yes, the deadly Ebolavirus wreaks its havoc with only seven proteins. In comparison, we humans have just under 20,000.)
The second drug is a different type modified RNA molecule, AVI-7537, from Sarepta Therapeutics. AVI-7537 is directed against one of the three Ebolavirus genes (VP24) targeted by Tekmira’s drug. But its chemistry platform, called PMOplus, is distinctly different from that of Tekmira’s TKM-Ebola. AVI-7537 also works via a different mechanism to block the viral protein from being made.
For those interested in the technical aspects of the chemistry and mechanism, this open-access 2012 paper in the journal, Viruses, is invaluable.
AVI-7537 has already shown effectiveness in non-human primates against the Zaire Ebolavirus, the species implicated in the current outbreak. Moreover, Sarepta had been conducting Phase 1 safety trials with the drug alone and together another Ebola-directed PMOplus molecule (AVI-7539, with the combination called AVI-6002).
The work, done with the support of the Department of Defense, was part of a project put on hold in 2012 during the fiscal cliff fiasco.
The Ebola drug proved to have an excellent safety profile in a single dose escalation study and a two-week, daily dosing regimen. So the discontinuation was more likely due to economics than medical concerns. In support of that speculation, the DoD continued to support Sarepta’s Marburg virus program.
Sarepta’s drug remains available
Sarepta’s president and CEO, Chris Garabedian, told Barron’s earlier this week that the company had a drug that could be deployed and shipped if a request was made of the company and all permits and authorizations were cleared.
Garabedian told me on Tuesday that company does indeed have clinical trial-quality drug on hand. The Marburg program that has continued “uses the same backbone chemistry,” so the safety studies that are continuing with that drug at higher human doses could be applied to AVI-7537.
“We’re here to raise awareness that we do have a technology that might be helpful, and that we do have drug substance on hand if we received a request from a government agency,” said Garabedian. “We, of course, would have to get the appropriate waivers and approvals from the Department of Defense who supported the development of this compound as well as the FDA in terms of an emergency use authorization.”
The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) is a co-assignee on the two patents, not expiring until 2025, that cover Sarepta’s Ebolavirus drugs.
Beyond the fact that the U.S. government has already made a significant investment in Sarepta’s drug, the company already holds an open IND for human clinical trials.
“We’re just highlighting that we have drug substance available and we can go to convert that into finished product in vials. Assuming all approvals are there from the various agencies, we could have this ready in a week for compounding in a pharmacy for dosing into a patient,” said Garabedian.
Should any agency or institution wish to make such a request, this wouldn’t be the first time Sarepta had made a drug available on an emergency basis. In fact, the genesis of Sarepta’s Ebola program was the government’s acute need for a drug.
“This started with a real-world situation where a researcher at USAMRIID had a needle-stick injury with Ebola and the company was called to see if we could turn around a drug candidate over a weekend,” said Garabedian. “Within five or six days, we had drug on a plane to dose this patient.”
“Fortunately for this woman, she didn’t test seropositive (indicating exposure to the virus) so she didn’t receive the drug. But that started our animal work and led to a lot of other collaborations with the government.”
We contacted USAMRIID’s Dr. Sina Bavari, for more information on the potential clinical utility of AVI-7537. Bavari is the lead investigator in the government partnership and senior co-author on peer-reviewed publications with the Sarepta drugs. While he promptly acknowledged our request, press officer Cmdr. Amy Derrick-Frost, USN, from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs responded, “At this time, we are not doing interviews.”
