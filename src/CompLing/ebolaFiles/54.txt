CDC Criteria For Ebola Transmission: “Being Within 3 Feet” or “In Same Room” Can Lead To Infection

















The Pontiac Tribune


Public health officials and the corporate media haven’t been telling you the truth regarding the Ebola outbreak.














For months, any time you heard mainstream news discuss the topic, they have made it a priority to insist Ebola is only transferred by exchanging bodily fluids.


SCG News has suspected for some time now that this is not true. Recent changes made by CDC criteria for Ebola transmission seem to suggest this claim is correct.






From the CDC update:


“A low risk exposure includes any of the following:

Household member or other casual contact with an EVD patient.
Providing patient care or casual contact without high-risk exposure with EVD patients in health care facilities in EVD outbreak affected countries.“


How does CDC define “casual contact“?

“Casual contact is defined as a) being within approximately 3 feet or within the room or care area for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or having direct brief contact (e.g., shaking hands) with an EVD case while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment.”

This is an interesting update, considering a study conducted in 2012 showed how Ebola was able to travel between pigs and monkeys that were in separate cages and were never placed in direct contact.

Dr. Gary Kobinger, from the National Microbiology Laboratory at the Public Health Agency of Canada, told BBC News that he believed Ebola was spread by droplets suspended in the air.

“What we suspect is happening is large droplets; they can stay in the air, but not long; they don’t go far,” he explained. “But they can be absorbed in the airway, and this is how the infection starts, and this is what we think, because we saw a lot of evidence in the lungs of the non-human primates that the virus got in that way.”

Why has the mainstream media and public officials been trying to convince the public the virus could not travel through the air? Important cautions could have been put in place already to reduce the outbreak of the virus, and they have not been taken because of this lie.

From CNN:
“Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people.”

The AP’s spin on it:
“Experts say people infected with Ebola can spread the disease only through their bodily fluids and after they show symptoms.”

And from the BBC itself in their article describing the second confirmed case in Nigeria:
“The virus spreads by contact with infected blood and bodily fluids – and touching the body of someone who has died of Ebola is particularly dangerous.”

The truth of the matter is, this strain of Ebola is not Ebola Zaire. This is a new strain. According to the CDC this virus is genetically 97% similar to the Zaire strain.

Warnings from Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, take on a whole new meaning with the recent change made by the CDC criteria for Ebola transmission.

Will the corporate media continue to mislead the public?

There is a new and unique development in human history that is taking place around the world; it is unprecedented in reach and volume, and it is also the greatest threat to all global power structures: the ‘global political awakening’. -Andrew Gavin Marshall
