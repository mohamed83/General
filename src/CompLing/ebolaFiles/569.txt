Families travel for miles and end up sitting outside overwhelmed clinics, waiting to die, because there is no room inside. This is wrong.This disease can be stopped. We know what to do. Personnel, materials, and international coordination are urgently needed. The U.N. estimates that donors need to step up with $1 billion, and that number could rise. So we've got to act faster and do more right now.We need our leaders to do more than just talk about this epidemic. We need them to act now. We don't have a day to waste.  Add your name, and urge your leader to step up and act on Ebola now.To: Secretary General Ban Ki-moonWe're counting on you to quickly make bold commitments and help end the Ebola epidemic now.Sincerely,[Your name here] Supporters3485Anita MurraySaugus, MA55 seconds ago3484Mary BostHempstead, NY5 minutes ago3483Chris SmithCorpus Christi, TX28 minutes ago3482Marguerite SmuklerBerkeley, CA2 hours ago3481Robert OrndorffOklahoma City, OK4 hours ago3480Linda PrinceSanta Fe, NM6 hours ago3479Debbie DonnellyCatonsville, MD6 hours ago3478Dionna AliNew Market, MD6 hours ago3477Avis DeckAndover, KS7 hours ago3476AnonymousZionsville, IN7 hours ago3475Julie  Le BlancRockland, ME7 hours ago3474Sarah AnthonyUnited Kingdom8 hours ago3473Richard WellesRichmond, VA9 hours ago3472Mel BrundickWestminster, MD10 hours agoGet MoreHealth & BeautyPoliticsSocial Justice
