Ebola Has Landed

The amount of real time media coverage two American Ebola patients have received has been extraordinary.  It may even be the most attention any medical condition has received by the modern media.  Meanwhile in Africa the current Ebola outbreak is spreading despite local efforts to control the disease, highlighting our misunderstanding of real and imagined disease threats.  The disease is now a serious healthcare challenge in four West African countries – Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and most recently, Nigeria.  In the eight days between July 24 and August 1, 285 new cases of Ebola were identified in Africa and 118 people died.
The two Americans infected with Ebola are making progress towards recovery, which reflects how focused treatment and technology can fulfill the vision of what we want healthcare to be.  Unfortunately, the experience among patients in Africa reflects the usual reality of disease progression – rampant disease and dire outcomes.  Even Dr. Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, admitted, “This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it.”

The World Health Organization has allocated $100 million to combat the spread of Ebola.  It is a totally underwhelming amount given the geographical extent of the threatened area and the large number of people who have already been exposed to the disease.  The U.S. needs to allocate significant resources to keep Ebola out of the U.S. and this means addressing it in Africa, while it is containable. The containment protocols espoused over the weekend by CDC officials for the U.S. are to identify and to isolate the patients’ family, friends and other contacts until the incubation period has passed in the U.S.  Without the same approach in Africa, all our vigilance and infrastructure may only allow the U.S. to more successfully treat the disease than other countries, but we will not be able to stop its coming to our shores.
Returning to the two treated Americans, they received an experimental drug named ZMapp which had previously only been used on monkeys.  It was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc.  Dr. Kent Brantly was the first of the Americans to be treated with ZMapp.  He is the voluntary medical worker in Africa, who arrived in Atlanta, GA over the weekend and was immediately taken to a special wing of Emory University Hospital.  Nancy Writebol, a medical missionary, who is due to arrive at Emory Hospital today, is the second person treated with ZMapp.
ZMapp is a serum that is administered in three doses and was produced using a three-mouse monoclonal antibody that has been developed in specially-designed tobacco plants.  Mice that were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus developed antibodies against the disease.  The antibodies that the mice produced were extracted and used to treat patients.  To allay any concerns of “exotic” technology, the use of monoclonal antibodies has a long and successful history.  Mouse antibodies are even a component of one of the first biological anti-arthritis drugs, Remicade, developed by Centocor Biotech, Inc., which is now part of Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). On the tobacco side, there is also a great body of knowledge surrounding use of genetically modified tobacco plants to grow drugs.  These are not the types of tobacco products grown by the likes of Altria Group Altria Group Inc. (MO), the world’s largest tobacco company.
While the technology for the new Ebola treatment is impressive, the Ebola realities are sobering with more than 1,603 cases and 887 deaths having been reported thus far. But, it is almost certain the disease is more extensive than reported.  Dr. Chan reported that frightened patients had left hospital isolation wards, leading to many cases that have not been reported. As a consequence, there may be many more cases that have been treated privately by families in remote villages, distant from government and medical observation, leading to even broader distribution of the disease than previously believed.

The transfer of the two American patients to the U.S. has raised concerns about the disease escaping the Emory Hospital confines and infecting people in the U.S.  In assessing real risks, these two patients, who were intentionally brought to America with Ebola are being handled too carefully for there to be an accidental transmission.  However, given the current trajectory of events and global travel patterns, there is a high likelihood that others will become infected in America.  In that scenario, the current Ebola surge, like a firestorm, will spiral out of control and feed on itself to the extent that it becomes self-sustaining.  In the four countries where the disease is now present and in many of their neighboring states, the political systems are unstable, the public health infrastructures fragile and the general population has too few resources to adequately isolate and care for the sick.
How we respond to Africa and the Ebola threat today directly affects what happens here tomorrow.  If the Ebola epidemic does not burn out there, it will become a different kind of problem and then we will have more than just perception to deal with here.
