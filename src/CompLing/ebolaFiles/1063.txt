            Posted on Sunday, September 7, 2014    
The Hilton in uptown Saint John is in lockdown after emergency crews received a medical call to the hotel.
The woman is believed to have just returned from Africa. No word on what her symptoms were, or how many people came into contact with her.
She was found unconscious in a seventh floor room and was taken to hospital.
A strong police presence remains on the scene any everyone in the hotel has been asked not to leave.
According to Platoon Chief Eric Garland they're currently following safety protocols and waiting to hear back from Ambulance NB to ensure the situation is safe.
