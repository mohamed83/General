The Liberian MOHSW report #103 for 8-26 showed 823 deaths, and today's report #105 shows deaths of 896, up 73 in the last 2 days, by their calculations. Report #102 showed 28 deaths on 8-25, #103 indicated 52 deaths for 8-26, (I cannot find report #104 for 8-27) and report #105 says 51 deaths for 8-28. MOHSW deaths from report #97 at 613 rising to 823 in #105 over 6 days are an average of 35 deaths per day, and rising to 896 on 8-28 were up 73, or 36.5 per day.

My guess is that there are corpses that are located outside, are buried without being tested, and that MOHSW includes them in their death numbers, but that WHO may exclude because they were not confirmed EVD victims. The rapid rise in new cases might be of more concern, as well as a better indicator of short-term changes in the rate of infection.
