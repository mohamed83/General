Disease Categories
Twelve disease categories are used to help you quickly find what you're looking for within your local area. Most of the categories refer to where the disease affects your body, such as Gastrointestinal for cholera or Respiratory for pneumonia. We also keep track of environmental risks (i.e. beach closures due to sewage) and animal diseases (i.e. foxes found with rabies) to provide you a broader picture of diseases in your area.
The number of alerts in each category determines the order in which they appear in the Outbreaks Near Me section. The category with the greatest number of alerts appears first. Categories that have no alerts in your area are not displayed.

Activity Index 

LowHighCountryLocalMarker ColorMarker color reflects the noteworthiness of events at a particular location during a given time window. An event's degree of noteworthiness is based on the significance rating of the alert provided by HealthMap users. In the absence of user ratings, the system assigns a composite score based on the disease importance and the news volume associated with the alert. If a location's marker has multiple alerts, the color associated with the most prominent alert is used.Marker SizeThe large circle indicates a country-level alert, while state, province and local alerts are indicated by the small circle.
