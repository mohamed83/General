He made the call while addressing delegates attending the ECOWAS Ministerial meeting which is taking place in Accra, Ghana.Dr Sambo said: “WHO has noticed that a number of countries in the region are taking decisions inconsistent with the recommendations of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee.  For instance, some countries have closed borders and entry points with and banned flights to and from affected countries isolating and stigmatizing them and making it difficult to transport supplies, personnel and other resources”.The Regional Director stressed the need for appropriate intersectoral measures to mitigate the negative economic and social effects of the current Ebola outbreak in order to protect the economies of the affected countries, sustain the health gains made so far and prevent humanitarian crisis.In his opening remarks, the President John Mahama of Ghana highlighted the negative socio-economic impact of the disease on the continent and the need for countries to generate home-grown solutions to solve their problems. He said: “The spread of the virus in the sub-region must remind us of the fierce urgency to develop regional solutions to our common social problems.”He underscored the importance of cross-border collaboration saying: “I am confident that working together across borders and with strong political will, we can defeat this outbreak and save many lives. We must rally all available resources and to ensure that the integrity and functionality of our health systems are maintained. We must give the maximum support, resources and motivation to our dedicated health professional to boost their ability and readiness to deal with this disease”.President Mahama acknowledged the significant pledges of resources by the international community organizations including the WHO, the United Nations (UN), the World Bank among others but said: “We must not rest until Ebola is completely defeated”.Speaking at the meeting, the President of the ECOWAS Commission, Kadre Ouedraogo echoed the remarks of the WHO Regional Director stressing that the closure of borders and other restrictions will have negative repercussion on the economy of countries and even adversely affect the capacities to mobilise the resources needed to fight the disease. “It is therefore necessary to review these measures in line with the recommendations of WHO and taking due cognizance of the spirit of solidarity, the pillar and guidance principle of the integration of our region”.In March 2014 Guinea notified WHO of confirmed cases of Ebola virus Disease. The cases were initially confined to rural Guinea with the epicenter being Gueckedou. What started as a rural outbreak has now spread to Conakry the capital of Guinea as well as cross border spread into Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.The ongoing Ebola outbreak is the largest reported to date in terms of number of cases, deaths and geographical spread._________________________For further information please contact:C.
