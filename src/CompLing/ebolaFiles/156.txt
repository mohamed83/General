In Summary
Two other health workers receiving the serum are still in treatment, said the minister, adding that there were “signs of hope”. Liberia took delivery of ZMapp on August 13 from the United States, which gave the serum to two US citizens who were declared cured last week.Meanwhile, the UN’s new pointman on Ebola said Monday the fight against the epidemic was a “war” which could take another six months, and warned that airlines boycotting the region were hampering the response.

A Liberian doctor treated with experimental American anti-Ebola serum ZMapp has died, the west African nation said Monday.Dr Abraham Borbor had been improving but died on Sunday night, Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown told AFP.“He was showing signs of progress but he finally died. The government regrets this loss and extends its condolences to the bereaved family,” Brown said.Two other health workers receiving the serum are still in treatment, said the minister, adding that there were “signs of hope”. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday there had been a “significant improvement” in the condition of a doctor and nurse being treated with ZMapp in Liberia, and that another doctor was getting better, but still in a serious condition.Liberia took delivery of ZMapp on August 13 from the United States, which gave the serum to two US citizens who were declared cured last week.The Americans were infected in Liberia along with a Spanish priest who died on August 12, despite also receiving ZMapp.The very small available stocks of ZMapp, which has never been through clinical trials on humans, have now been used up, according to the lab that produces it.JAPAN OFFERMeanwhile, Tokyo said on Monday it was ready to offer an experimental drug developed by a Japanese company to help stem the global tide of Ebola. Avigan, which is taken in tablet form, was approved as an anti-influenza drug in Japan in March and is currently in clinical tests in the United States. On Sunday, the Democratic Republic of Congo confirmed its two first cases of Ebola this year, but claimed they were unrelated to the epidemic raging in four countries of West Africa.The UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) meanwhile announced that one of its health experts, an epidemiologist, had been infected while working in Sierra Leone. The sobering news of Ebola’s spread came as UN officials pledged to step up efforts against the lethal tropical virus, which has infected more than 2,600 and killed 1,427, according to WHO figures released Friday.In Kinshasa, Congolese Health Minister Felix Kabange Numbi said that two of eight samples taken from victims of a mystery fever had tested positive for Ebola. “The results are positive. The Ebola virus is confirmed in DRC,” Mr Kabange told AFP.Speaking later on public television, he said the confirmation marked the seventh outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo, where the virus was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola River. But he said the two new cases had “no link to [the epidemic] raging in West Africa” and were different strains from one another. Authorities immediately imposed a quarantine around the affected area in Equateur province near Jera, more than 1,200 kilometres northeast of the Congolese capital Kinshasa. Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders said it was sending a crew to help handle patients in the area.SIX MONTHS Meanwhile, the UN’s new pointman on Ebola said Monday the fight against the epidemic was a “war” which could take another six months, and warned that airlines boycotting the region were hampering the response.Dr David Nabarro, a British physician the United Nations has appointed to coordinate the global response to the crisis, was in Sierra Leone’s capital Freetown for the fifth day of a tour of the region. “The effort to defeat Ebola is not a battle but a war which requires everybody working together, hard and effectively,” he told a news conference.“I hope it will be done in six months but we have to do it until it is completed.”Dr Nabarro said airlines halting flights to and from the countries that have been afflicted by the outbreak in west Africa were making the UN’s efforts “a whole lot harder”. “By isolating the country, it makes it difficult for the UN to do its work,” he said.Instead, he issued a “really strong request to everyone to help us find a way to continue having airlines fly into these capitals so that we can do our job properly”.
