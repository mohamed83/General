@drsanjaygupta what if someone with Ebola sneezes and you breathe it in? That's coming in contact with a bodily fluid.

@drsanjaygupta All true but nuance of fomite transmission (e.g. saliva on shared forks etc) lost a bit in oversimplification.

@drsanjaygupta i liken it to the AIDS epidemic early on - the news, the information, the paranoia was out of control, and none accurate.
