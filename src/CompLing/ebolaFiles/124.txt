ATLANTA—The Charlotte missionary infected with the deadly Ebola virus while working in Africa arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Nancy Writebol will join Dr. Kent Brantly for treatment inside a specialized isolation unit.Nancy Writebol was wheeled into Emory University Hospital just before 1:00 on Tuesday afternoon.Doctors in hazmat suits navigated the stretcher through the grounds into the special isolation unit.SIM USA President Bruce Johnson visibly choked up several times thanking staff at Emory University Hospital as the Charlotte missionary settles in at Emory University and begins her Ebola treatmentEveryone was hoping for another uplifting moment like what was seen this weekend with her colleague, Dr. Kent Brantly who was able to walk himself into the hospital, but that wasn't the case. It appears Nancy Writebol at this time is just too weak as she continues to fight this deadly infection.Writebol did have yogurt before she got on plane from Liberia, however, and briefly stood on her own.Officials say Dr. Brantly's condition continues to improve. Both Writebol and Brantly have been given an experimental serum to help treat Ebola. Brantly's condition perked up within an hour of getting the treatment, but Writebol didn't experience quite the same impact.The Writebol family said they were profoundly grateful of U.S. government's assistance and well wishers from across North Carolina and the world. This is part of a note Writebol's husband relayed Tuesday to SIM USA leaders."'A week ago,' he said, 'we were thinking about possible funeral arrangements, yet we kept our faith. Now we have a real reason to be hopeful,'" said Bruch Johnson, SIM USA president.Nancy Writebol was serving with Dr. Brantly in Liberia. Her son Jeremy is in Atlanta and her husband David is expected to join them in the coming days.
