			Sierra Leone launches nationwide 'lockdown' to halt spread of Ebola

Citizens of the West African nation will be prohibited from leaving their homes for four days from September 18 as part of efforts to stop the Ebola virus spreading further. 
....

Sierra Leone will impose a four* day, countrywide "lockdown" starting Sept. 18, an escalation of efforts to halt the spread of Ebola across the West African nation, a senior official in the president's office said on Friday.

Citizens will not be allowed to leave their homes on September 18*-21 in a bid to prevent the disease from spreading further and allow health workers to identify cases in the early stages of the illness, said Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, a presidential adviser on the country's Ebola task force.

....
As of Friday, Sierra Leone has recorded 491 of the total of 2,097 deaths blamed on Ebola in West Africa since March, UN figures showed.

Re: Sierra Leone launches nationwide 'lockdown' to halt spread of Ebola





Sierra Leone lockdown will not help halt Ebola: MSF

By David Lewis
DAKAR Sat Sep 6, 2014 12:23pm EDT

(Reuters) - Sierra Leone's proposed countrywide "lockdown" will not help control an Ebola outbreak and could lead to the disease spreading further as cases are concealed, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Saturday.

The government plans to order citizens not to leave the areas around their homes for three days from Sept. 19 in a bid to halt new infections and help health workers track down people suffering from the disease, the information ministry said on Saturday.

"It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers," said the group.

"This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further," added the group which has been helping fight the world's biggest outbreak of the disease across West Africa.

Re: Sierra Leone launches nationwide 'lockdown' to halt spread of Ebola





			
			I am scratching my head over this one. Why would officials think a three or four day quarantine would be effective in reducing the spread of Ebola? Is this a ruse to establish a significantly longer quarantine?

Re: Sierra Leone launches nationwide 'lockdown' to halt spread of Ebola





The view from Sierra Leone as it faces a governent-imposed Ebola lockdown

Updated by Julia Belluz on September 7, 2014, 1:00 p.m.
... 
Ishmeal Alfred Charles, who has been working on the Ebola front-line in Freetown, Sierra Leone, says people are devastated about the drastic move. This is what he told Vox:

"This is the first time a lockdown is happening under normal circumstances. During the rebel wars, people did it on their own, for their own safety.

It is only under Ebola we have been faced with such an unfortunate situation.

I feel so terrible about the lockdown. It will multiply the psychosocial impact.

No schooling, no business, nothing is happening. Poverty is on the increase. People are suffering and dying not only from Ebola but from its effects.

This is a sad times for us."

Re: Sierra Leone launches nationwide 'lockdown' to halt spread of Ebola





Sierra Leone launches controversial Ebola shutdown

sept 19 2014

Sierra Leone on Friday launched a controversial three-day shutdown to contain the deadly spread of the Ebola virus, as the UN Security Council declared the deadly outbreak a threat to world peace.

Most of Sierra Leone's population of six million were confined to their homes from midnight, with only essential workers such as health professionals and security forces exempt from the lockdown, AFP reports.

Almost 30,000 volunteers will go door-to-door to educate locals and hand out soap, in an exercise that could lead to scores more patients and bodies being discovered in people's homes.

Health experts have criticised the shutdown, arguing that coercive measures to stem the epidemic could backfire and would be extremely hard to implement.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned that lockdowns may end up driving people underground "and jeopardise the trust between people and health providers''.

But Sierra Leone President Ernest Koroma said that if the population were to heed the volunteers' advice, "the campaign will greatly help to reverse the increasing trend of the disease transmission and become a very big boost to our collective effort to stop the outbreak.''

"These are extraordinary times and extraordinary times require extraordinary measures,'' added Koroma in a message broadcast on television and radio.
The extreme move comes amid mounting global concern over the Ebola epidemic, which has so far killed more than 2,600 people in west Africa.

S. Leone's Ebola shutdown uncovers 70 dead in capital


from Agence France-Presse 
09/21/2014 12:34 GMT
by Rod MAC JOHNSON

FREETOWN, September 21, 2014 (AFP) - Sierra Leone wrapped up its 72-hour shutdown on Sunday, with authorities reporting that the action aimed at containing the Ebola epidemic had uncovered up to 70 dead bodies in and around the capital.

Most of the west African country's six million people were confined to their homes for a third straight day, with only essential workers such as health professionals and security forces exempt.

Almost 30,000 volunteers have been going door-to-door to educate locals and hand out soap, in an exercise that was expected to lead to scores more patients and bodies being discovered in homes.

Deputy Chief Medical Officer Sarian Kamara revealed that the authorities had received thousands of calls but only a handful of new patients in the Western Area covering Freetown and its surroundings.

"We were... able to confirm new cases which, had they not been discovered, would have greatly increased transmission," she said.

"Up to this morning, we had 22 new cases. The response from the medical (teams) has improved and the burial teams were able to bury between 60 to 70 corpses over the past two days."
