President GEJ Calls Patrick Sawyer (The Liberian That Brought #Ebola) A ‘Crazy Man’





Follow @irepidreamz
My president…you did not lie Jaree!…The man was absolutely bonkers..look at what he has done to naija now….lol!
While speaking at the annual Interfaith conference today in Abuja, Naija’s main man, President Goodluck Jonathan expressed his utter dissapointment and disgust at the way Patrick Sawyer brought the Ebola virus to Nigeria.
He said;
My conversation with the WHO DG, Dr Margaret Chan was revealing, she said 60 per cent of the transmission was spread during burials. That is why in my announcement, I’ve been saying that people should be careful about burials.
Some people like burial ceremonies. This is not the time for burial ceremony, somebody is dead, he is dead, leave him there. This is not the best time for those ceremonies.
If he is dead, he is already dead, Sawyer that brought this Ebola to Nigeria; his sister died of Ebola. And he started acting somehow, his country asked him not to leave the country, let them observe him, but the crazy man decided to leave and found his way here.”
