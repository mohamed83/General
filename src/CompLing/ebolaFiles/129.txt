The family of Dessie Quinn have been told by the HSE that he did not die of ebola.The HSE was investigating a possible outbreak of the killer virus but blood tests have come back negative.Mr Quinn, 44, found dead in Mountcharles, Donegal on Thursday and was taken to LetterKenny Hospital to an isolated unit.He had recently returned home from Sierra Leone and was being treated for malaria when he died suddenly.As a precaution, the HSE implemented disease control measures but the man's family have now been told the results were negative.The World Health Organisation has branded it the largest ever recorded outbreak of the disease, with around 700 confirmed deaths so far.The latest outbreak began in the African nation of Guinea this February, before moving to Liberia and Sierra Leone.Ebola alert Ireland: Blood test results show Donegal man Dessie Quinn did NOT have killer disease




7:36 am

 

Health chiefs put Letterkenny General hospital on lockdown last night over fears the Ebola virus had claimed its first victim in Ireland.Staff in Letterkenny General Hospital isolated the body of Dessie Quinn pending the results of blood tests today which will reveal whether he had the killer virus.The 43-year-old had returned to Ireland last week from Sierra Leone which is one of the country’s worst hit by the crisis.He is thought to have been living with his partner in Dublin but was visiting his family just outside Mountcharles in Donegal when he fell ill.The father of one was believed to have been suffering from malaria at the time of his death and had returned from the West African country where he worked with a telecommunications company.Mr Quinn became unwell shortly before 2.30am yesterday and died at his parents’ home. His body was transferred to Letterkenny General Hospital. Local priest Fr Adrian Gavigan visited to perform the last rites.He said the Quinn family are very well respected in the area and added: “This has come as an awful shock to them. I genuinely hope that this is not confirmed.”The cleric told how as far as he was concerned the dead man’s family knew nothing about an Ebola scare and there had been no mention of the virus until late yesterday afternoon, and everyone presumed he had died of malaria.Fr Gavigan added: “I’m not sure how this has all come about. Perhaps if this was a year ago and Ebola was not being talked about, then we would not have this situation now.“There was never any mention of Ebola and everyone just presumed that he was showing all the signs of malaria. I’m not sure how this has come out or how the hospital has come to this conclusion. I just hope for the family’s sake that this is not the case.”




7:52 am

 

There was good news on the battle to cure the disease yesterday.Two charity workers who contracted Ebola as they helped fight the epidemic in West Africa were released from hospital after successful experimental treatment.Doctor Kent Brantly worked with Christian aid organisation Samaritan’s Purse in Liberia treating patients when he fell ill with the disease.The 33-year-old and fellow American Nancy Writebol, an aid worker who also contracted Ebola while in the country, were airlifted back to the States amid much controversy for treatment.Dr. Brantly had selflessly insisted Ms Writebol should be given the only vial of experimental medicine when they fell ill last month.Instead he was given a “unit of blood” from a 14-year-old who had survived Ebola – which some doctors believe would contain antibodies strong enough to fight off the virus.The pair were held in the acute isolation centre at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after arriving earlier this month.Several Americans, including billionaire Donald Trump, expressed outrage over the decision to bring them back to the States fearing they could spread the disease.




8:20 am

 

It's understood Mr Quinn worked as an engineer for a company based in Clondalkin, Dublin.His firm had been hired to provide 600km of digital cabling and wi-fi in Sierra Leone and along its borders with Guinea and Liberia.Along with Nigeria, all three countries have been at the centre of the ebola scare.There have been reports that some of Mr Quinn's work colleagues may have also contracted the virus.




8:21 am

 

The Mayor of Donegal and Mountcharles native Councillor John Campbell, who went to school with the deceased, said: “It’s a big shock in the area, I know the family well. My thoughts are with his family now.”He also urged for people to remain calm, saying: “It is unconfirmed it is Ebola at this stage and even if it was confirmed the chances of it being passed on to anyone else are very small so people shouldn’t panic.”One local man who knew the suspected victim said: “I met him at a festival in Mountcharles last week and he looked fine. He looked grand, he looked like Dessie, he didn’t look as if he was in bad health.”




8:23 am

 

More than 1,350 people have died from the disease in West Africa, according to the World Health Organisation, which has declared the Ebola epidemic a global health emergency.Meanwhile a village herbalist who claimed she had special powers to heal Ebola victims is said to have been responsible for the spread of the killer disease to Sierra Leone causing 365 deaths.The outbreak in the country may never have happened if she hadn’t boasted she could cure suffers, which led to infected victims crossing the border from Guinea.The woman, who lived in the eastern border of village of Sokoma, was then engulfed by so many victims she contracted the killer disease which has claimed 1,350 lives so far.Health official Mohammed Vandi, in charge of the hardest-hit district of Kenema, said: “She got infected herself and died. During her funeral, women around the other towns got infected.“She was claiming to have powers to heal Ebola and cases from Guinea started crossing the border into Sierra Leone for treatment.”




9:12 am

 

Damien Quelly, of child poverty charity, Plan Ireland, saw the effects of the Ebola virus in West Africa.He had this to say on the killer disease."When I was in Guinea in March, I witnessed the initial spread of the Ebola virus."But at the time none of us thought we were seeing the start of the most deadly outbreak on record which has claimed 1,350 lives."As Plan Ireland’s deputy regional director for West Africa, I am helping to direct our response in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone."We have been working for four months to contain the disease’s rapid spread."In Liberia for instance, people have claimed the outbreak is “worse than war”."Part of a sound effort to halt the outbreak is to tackle the misconceptions people have towards the virus."Some are not seeking medical attention as they believe Ebola can be attributed to witchcraft."With weak health systems and a fast-spreading illness, this outbreak is one step ahead of the under-resourced response to combat it."With no effective treatment, raising awareness of Ebola and the measures people can take are some of the ways to reduce infection and death."To donate to Plan Ireland’s work visit www.plan.ie.

A Nigerian woman with cancer who died in the Emirati capital this week has tested negative for Ebola, the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi said.The 35-year-old woman with advanced cancer had been traveling via Abu Dhabi airport when her health deteriorated. When medics tried to resuscitate her, the patient had shown signs that may have been consistent with the Ebola virus."Some of her signs during resuscitation, although explainable by her medical condition, could also have been caused by Ebola virus, and hence this diagnosis needed to be excluded," the authority said in a statement according to the state WAM news agency on Thursday.At the time, the patient's husband and the five medics who tried to resuscitate her were put in isolation. The Health Authority said none of them had shown any symptoms."Given the negative result, all these are individuals are scheduled to be released from isolation today (Thursday)," the statement added.Reuters




9:58 am

 

Mr Quinn's family are said to be 'very annoyed' that they were not informed about tests for ebola before the HSE released a statement.Fr Adrian Gavigan, who has been speaking with the family in Mountcharles, Co Donegal, said Mr Quinn was being treated for Malaria.He told the BBC: "The family are very annoyed by it. They are grieving. They have lost a son, a brother."In its own way, that is very hard to take when there is a sudden death. However, this was the first time they had heard of this news."He was a young man being treated for malaria for a number of weeks."They are very distraught, numb at his death. It is a shock. If anything, they are grieving more than they are angry."However, I am very angry and think it was very impersonal for the HSE to release a statement without giving the family any warning."




10:14 am

 

Fr Gavigan also appeared on Today with Sean O'Rourke on RTE Radio One, where he repeated that he was angry the family hadn't been informed.He said: "I was quite shocked and angry, and I thought it was very impersonal."However, a spokesman for the HSE said that they had been in contact with some members of the Quinn family from the outset.Fr Gavigan said that the family's priority now is to bring Dessie's body home to Mountcharles, where they can allow him to rest in peace.He said: "It's really rocked and shaken the family, and the community here. The family are very well known and are very much a part of the community here."




10:27 am

 

The firm Mr Quinn worked for have issued a statement expressing their 'deepest sympathies and sorrow' for his family.KN Network Services, which has returned all its staff from Sierra Leone where Mr Quinn was working, said: "Dessie was an extremely hard working and valued member of staff and was very popular with all his colleagues and he will be missed by everybody who worked with him."The company have offered their support to the Quinn family in Donegal."KNNS have also had ongoing contacts and discussions with HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre."




11:01 am

 

Some more information is emerging on Mr Quinn's last days before his death.Mr Quinn, whose girlfriend and son live in Dublin, had returned to his family home in Doorin, Mountcharles, Donegal, to spend time with relatives and friends.Although he was being treated for malaria on his return, he was not an inpatient in hospital and was well enough to be out socialising with friends in the evenings before he died. He had gone to bed at a friend's house on Wednesday night after complaining of feeling unwell.It is understood the family are hoping to get the results of the blood tests at around midday.The HSE declined to comment on when the checks would be completed or when information would be passed on to the family and the public.Relatives, friends and neighbours gathered at the home in Doorin late last night and Mr Quinn's friend, who was with him in the hours before he was found dead, was also at the house.

Here's the statement from the HSE on claims that Mr Quinn's family were not informed of the tests for ebola before the media.The health body told RTE that it maintained close contact with the Quinn family and only issued a statement after media reports emerged.A spokeswoman said: "The HSE was in contact with some family members from the outset of the tragic situation yesterday."The story broke in the media just before 6pm yesterday at which point the HSE had to make a public statement on the matter, given the urgency and nature of a public health issue such as this."The HSE has expressed its sincere condolences to the family for their loss."




12:25 pm

 

Fr Adrian Gavigan was interviewed on RTE Radio's Today with Sean O'Rourke earlier this morning, discussing the impact Dessie Quinn's death has had on his family.

12:42 pm

 

The family of Dessie Quinn has been told by the HSE that he did not die of ebola.Independent TD Thomas Pringle said he was told this afternoon by the family that they had just received the news.Mr Pringle added that the family, despite the ease in their grief, are still furious and claim that the HSE did not tell them in advance that Dessie’s remains were undergoing laboratory tests for ebola, the killer virus which has swept Western Africa.Mr Quinn, 44, died in the early hours of Thursday in Mountcharles, Co Donegal, some weeks after returning home from Sierra Leone.Mr Pringle said: “The family insist that the first they knew of the tests was when they heard it on the 6 pm news on RTE on Thursday evening, several hours after the remains were removed to the mortuary at Letterkenny General Hospital.”He added: “It’s disgraceful that the family weren’t alerted before the statement was made public.“They are very annoyed with the HSE. They are also annoyed with the media coverage of the event.”




12:57 pm
