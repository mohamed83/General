Muscat: Oman's Ministry of Health (MoH) has urged the people planning to visit Saudi Arabia to perform Haj and Umrah to postpone their pilgrimage plan this year. The move followed the recommendations issued by Saudi Health Ministry in view of the risks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) spreading.According to the announcement, the pilgrims wishing to perform Haj and Umrah should get themselves vaccinated no less than 10 days before entering Saudi Arabia, comply with common health guidelines, remain alert to warnings issued by global health bodies and undergo medical checkups if they feel uneasiness after the pilgrimage."Pilgrims aged above 65, children aged below 12, those who are suffering from chronic diseases, cancer or terminal illness, pregnant women and people with immune deficiency syndrome should postpone their plans for pilgrimage," the announcement says.The step comes along side preventive measures against the spread of the Ebola and MERS viruses.In June, quoting a health ministry official, the Times of Oman confirmed that no new cases of MERS have been reported in Oman this year. The ministry's announcement states that the date of vaccination for people heading for Umrah should be valid in the card issued by the health institutions and in the forms issued by the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs for those heading for Haj."We have already sent our pilgrims to be administered vaccines at the government health centres. We will not take any risk in such a situation," Hassan Bava from a Haj and Umrah operating firm in Muscat, said."We are cautious about the situation. We are discouraging pilgrims who are showing signs of even slight uneasiness," Hassan added.Hassan's firm is sending 60 Indian expatriate to Haj this month."Our pilgrims will have a 20-day trip starting from September 18," Hassan said. Last year also, Hassan's firm had sent 60 pilgrims to perform Hajj from Oman.The Saudi Ministry of Health has also banned the issuance of Haj and Umrah visas for Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia because of concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus."We have communicated the instructions to the officials at ports of entry. We have trained our personnel on how to deal with Ebola cases, should it happen," Dr. Khalid Marghalani, spokesman of the MoH, told the media.On his part, Dr. Hussein Shareef, Ministry of Haj's undersecretary for Haj affairs, said the ministry would take all measures to ensure public health and safety.Reporter can be reached at reji@timesofoman.com
