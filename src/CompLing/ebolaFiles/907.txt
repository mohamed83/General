Ebola virus disease outbreak – west Africa
 
Disease outbreak news
4 September 2014

 
Epidemiology and surveillance 

WHO has committed to provide regular situation reports that include detailed epidemiological information and analysis, as well as regular monitoring of the national and international response to the outbreak against the Ebola response roadmap. 

Recognizing the demand for updated numbers from this outbreak, the following information is being released in advance of the second update of this situation report.  

As of 31 August 2014, 3685 (probable, confirmed and suspected) cases and 1841 deaths have been reported in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease by the Ministries of Health of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 

In Nigeria, there have been 21 cases and 7 deaths.

In Senegal, one case has been confirmed and there have been no Ebola deaths or further suspected cases. 

Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.
