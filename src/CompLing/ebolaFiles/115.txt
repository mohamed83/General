analysis
By Oghogho Obayuwana, Chukwuma Muanya And Emeka Anuforo With Agency ReportsAbuja — "The Ebola outbreak in the West African region remains uncontained with number of cases and deaths still increasing."
With these words, the World Health Organisation (WHO) at the weekend stressed that all the countries in the region remain at the risk of "importation" of the virus.
The organisation stressed that it had sent a team of experts to Lagos to work with the Federal and State Governments in putting in place necessary measures to contain the outbreak.
A statement from the body listed members of the team to include its regional and headquarters experts, made up of an epidemiologist and a case management specialist .
"With this assistance, WHO has since made available its guidelines and tools as well as use them to assist in training various categories of health workers on contact tracing, surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, Ebola case management, infection prevention and control and public health education using WHO Standard Operating Procedures, to support the country's efforts in containing further spread of Ebola virus," they noted.
It added: "The WHO tools provided also include, job aids, database software and training aids.
"WHO also provided personal protective equipment (PPE) and thermometers to supplement on those being sourced by the government. The team remains in Lagos to provide technical guidance and assist in closely monitoring the situation."
Already, West African countries have begun regional efforts to contain the spread of Ebola.
From today a four-man delegation will be visiting Togo to put in place epidemiological surveillance centres for beneficiary countries under the West African Disease Surveillance (WARDS) project. Other tasks in this regard are expected to follow in the coming weeks.
But the region, comprising 15 member states would need among others, to invest a minimum of $50 million to stand a chance of "prosecuting an effective response."


The campaign against the virus is being hampered by the realisation that the financial resources needed to respond to epidemic outbreaks are not within the reach of any single country within the region.
According to the West African Health Organisation (WAHO), besides measures already announced by the various health ministers, the countries must even without the financial outlay, manage to "implement synchronised cross-border interventions."
Other urgently needed measures include strengthening of preventive and control measures, active surveillance of cases, treatment and care of suspected cases, multi-sectorial coordination and collaboration, beefing up of logistic and material support, social mobilisation in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
In its intervention statement made available to The Guardian at the weekend, by the Burkina Faso-based organisation, also needed is "a strengthening of epidemiological surveillance, organisation of rapid assessments, social mobilisation, training of medical personnel etc. within all countries of the region."
The WHO wants the over 260 million citizens across the region to key into the safety precaution and curtailment measures as the best rampart against the virus.
Responding to The Guardian's enquiry in Abuja on what the regional group was doing to ensure the success of collaborative measures , the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) director of information, Mr. sunny Ugoh said: "Apart from what has been announced, the epidemiological situation in the three most affected countries is monitored weekly and emerging information is widely shared. Regular coordination meetings are held in the countries as well as the pursuit of advocacy visits to European Union delegation, Embassies of China, and France including USAID with the aim of securing assistance for affected countries. Meetings are also held with laboratories notably Pasteur Institute, CDC with a view to strengthening diagnostic capabilities."
"The commission has in addition always drawn attention to the letter sent to ECOWAS Ministers of Health reminding them of the need to comply with the provisions of the International Health Regulations governing the issue of border closures during epidemics and preventive measures to take at points of entry in their respective countries during the ongoing Ebola epidemic. Of course, letters were also addressed to the President of the ECOWAS Commission and Partners advocating mobilisation of additional resources to support affected countries."
He added : "When the 45th ECOWAS Summit of Heads of State and Governments held in Accra, Ghana, last month, Nigeria announced a total financial support of $3.5 million to assist affected countries. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra were given $1 million each while WAHO had $500,000 to enable the organisation to respond appropriately to epidemics."
But despite the absence of a vaccine or curative therapy, Ebola outbreaks could most certainly be contained by early detection and isolation of cases, contact tracing and monitoring of contacts, and rigorous procedures for infection control, according to the WHO.
The Director-General of WHO, Dr. Margaret Chan, in an overview of the Ebola situation delivered to the Presidents of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone said she had convened an Emergency Committee that would meet on August 6, 2014, to assess the international implications of West Africa's outbreak, under the provisions of the International Health Regulations.
