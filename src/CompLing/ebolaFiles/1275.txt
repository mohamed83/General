Red Sox 1B Napoli To Have Sleep Disorder Surgery (Yahoo Sports)
Boston Red Sox first baseman Mike Napoli will have surgery to treat a sleeping disorder. Napoli suffers from sleep apnea. The surgery involves repositioning the jaws and sometimes the tongue to keep the windpipe from becoming obstructed. Napoli told WEEI.com in Boston that he&#39;s been dealing with sleep apnea for a long time and has tried less drastic solutions like a mouthpiece or medicine. A year after helping the Red Sox win the World Series, Napoli batted .248 with 17 homers and 55 RBIs this season while fighting injuries to his finger, toe, knee and back.

ISIS Tactics Illustrate Social Media’s New Place In Modern War
In the past year, ISIS has used social media and the web to control the narrative of the conflict in Iraq and Syria. And though it borrows some tactics from propagandists like Vladimir Putin, ISIS has also proven a macabre trailblazer. Despite its grand ambitions of establishing a geographically transcendent caliphate, the terrorist group is not recognized as a nation-state, occupying a swath of territory stretching across Iraq and Syria conquered by brute force. Its decentralization has proven to be a big boon for its propaganda efforts, allowing ISIS to push out its story in a novel way. Because ISIS’s propaganda originates from thousands of individual sources, it’s much harder to counter.

Mark Zuckerberg Was Once One Of CNN's '10 People Who Don't Matter'
Mark Zuckerberg wasn&#39;t always the billionaire Internet mogul we know today. In 2006, just two years after Facebook &#39;s creator, Zuck was just another 20-something trying to make his way in the world wearing a hoodie. CNN&#39;s Business 2.0, a magazine that once lived as part of CNN Money, vastly underestimated his potential all those years ago, listing him as one of 10 People Who Don&#39;t Matter on its site. The site wrote off Zuckerberg&#39;s online social directory for college students as a passing fad.

The Market Is Having Another Awful Day
U.S. stocks tumbled in midday trading Wednesday as investor fears of a global economic slowdown intensified, setting the Dow Jones industrial average on course for its fourth consecutive loss. The Dow plunged as much as 369 points in the first 10 minutes of trading and swooned more than 400 points in the afternoon, following steep declines in Europe, as the market sized up the latest batch of corporate earnings and some discouraging data on retail sales and manufacturing. Traders dumped risky assets and parked their money in investments seen as relatively safe, such as U.S. government bonds. That pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly below 2%, the lowest level in more than a year.

Motorola Announces Which Of Its Phones Will Get Android 5.0 Lollipop
Given that Motorola is building Google’s just-announced Nexus 6, it’s probably also a given that Motorola knows their way around the latest version of Android, Lollipop. It makes sense, then, that they’re pretty much the first out of the gate to announce which of their phones are getting the update treatment. Though they’re mum on timing, Moto has just promised Lollipop updates for around half a dozen devices including the Moto X, Moto E, Moto G and Verizon’s Droid Ultra, Droid Maxx, and Droid Mini. Motorola is promising to announce more phones after they’ve worked with their “various partners” — which, in other words, means they’ve still got to figure out which carriers are willing to support which phones for a bit longer, and which will work with them on the update distribution process.

Dakar (AFP) - The Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 1,500 people across West Africa spread to a fifth country in the region on Friday with the first confirmed case of the deadly virus in Senegal.The case marks the first time a new country has been hit by the outbreak since July and comes a day after the World Health Organization warned the number of infections was increasing rapidly.Scientists meanwhile said the first human trials of a potential vaccine would start next week using a product made by pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline and the US government.On Friday, scientists writing in the journal Nature said 18 lab monkeys given high doses of the Ebola virus fully recovered after being given the prototype drug ZMapp, which reversed bleeding in the animals.ZMapp has been given to a handful of frontline health workers who have contracted Ebola, two of whom have recovered, and two of whom have died. Three others are still receiving the treatment.Senegal's health ministry said the country's first Ebola patient was a young Guinean man who was immediately quarantined at a Dakar hospital, where he was in a "satisfactory condition".The man is believed to have been infected in Guinea's capital Conakry, and may have travelled to Senegal before Dakar closed its land border with Guinea on August 21.Authorities are now scrabbling to piece together where he went and who he encountered, in a bid to halt the spread of the deadly virus.New figures released by the WHO on Thursday revealed the massive scale of the crisis, which it said indicated a "rapid increase still in the intensity of transmission" that could cost at least $490 million (370 million euros) to tackle.

In a sign that affected countries are struggling to stop its spread, the UN agency said the number of cases could exceed 20,000 before the epidemic is brought under control. - Under surveillance - Never before has there been an Ebola outbreak so large, nor has the virus -- which was first detected in 1976 -- ever infected people in West Africa until now.As of August 26, 1,552 people had been confirmed dead from Ebola in four countries -- Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.Liberia was the worst affected with 694 deaths; 422 people have died in Sierra Leone; and 430 in Guinea, where the virus emerged at the start of the year. Nigeria has now recorded six deaths.The Democratic Republic of Congo has also confirmed two cases of Ebola, but officials there insist it is unconnected to the current outbreak in West Africa.

Sierra Leone President Ernest Koroma on Friday sacked health minister Miatta Kargbo.A presidential statement read on state television said the decision was made "in order to create a conducive environment for more efficient and effective handling of the Ebola outbreak."Nigeria's latest death -- in the southeastern oil city of Port Harcourt -- was the first outside its biggest city, Lagos, and dashed hopes that the country had successfully contained the virus.The victim, a doctor named Ikyke Samuel Enuemo, is believed to have caught the virus from a patient he treated who travelled to the city after coming into contact with an infected Liberian-American man.Some 160 people are now under surveillance in Port Harcourt following the doctor's death, the local government said on Friday.Meanwhile a curfew was imposed in N'Zerekore, Guinea's second-largest city, a day after 20 people were injured during a protest by market stall holders against a team of health workers sent, without notice, to spray their market with disinfectant. - A shield around the region - In a bid to stop the spread of the virus, many African governments have sought to ringfence Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.But member states of the West African regional bloc ECOWAS complained Thursday that some of the security measures taken by other countries, including travel bans, had unfairly hit the region.A number of airlines, including Air France and British Airways, have suspended their services to Freetown and Monrovia, the capitals of Sierra Leone and Liberia respectively.Bruce Aylward, the WHO's head of emergency programmes, said it was "absolutely vital" that airlines resume flights because bans were hindering the emergency response.The outbreak has also caused sporting chaos, with Sierra Leone having to field all players for the qualifying games for the African Cup of Nations from outside the country over a growing quarantine.Morocco, which will host the tournament next year, said on Friday it was launching a national commission tasked with drawing up a health plan to deal with the risk from Ebola.Disease & Medical ConditionsInfectious DiseasesSenegalEbola outbreakWest Africa
