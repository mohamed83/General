Sierra Leone to enter ‘lockdown’ as Ebola death toll tops 2,000

RT | Sep 6, 2014 



Sierra Leone announced it will implement a four-day “lockdown” across
 the country in an attempt to contain the spread of Ebola. The Friday 
move came as the World Health Organization stated that the virus has so 
far claimed over 2,000 lives in Africa.

Beginning September 18,
  the nation will prohibit residents from leaving their homes for
  four days, with the hopes that health officials will be able to
  detect early-stage cases, Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, a presidential
  advisor in Sierra Leone, told Reuters.


“The aggressive approach is necessary to deal with the spread
  of Ebola once and for all,” he said.

Unfortunately, the news was accompanied by worsening statistics
  from the World Health Organization (WHO), which announced on
  Friday that out of the roughly 4,000 people that have been
  confirmed to have the virus, 2,105 people have died in Guinea,
  Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.


It marked a drastic rise in the death toll – a spike of about 500
  people since last week – and continued adding to what is already
  the most deadly Ebola epidemic since the virus was first detected
  in 1976.

As officials scramble to address the problem, a separate Reuters
  report revealed that drug companies are also
  trying to fast-track their efforts to bring new kinds of medicine
  to market. Multiple drugs have been labeled as potentially
  helpful by the WHO, but ZMapp, in particular, has attracted
  attention worldwide.


Developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, ZMapp first made headlines
  when it was administered to two American aid workers who
  had contracted Ebola, both of whom were flown out of Africa and
  recovered from the virus soon after. The drug has been
  successfully given to seven individuals total, but Mapp president
  Dr. Larry Zeitlin said that despite the US granting over $42
  million to speed up its testing, it still needs to undergo
  clinical trials – starting in 2015.


“The US support will enable us to figure out what the
  appropriate dose is and scale up manufacturing. With a drug you
  have not only to make it, but make it consistently to the same
  quality. The award given us is for 18 months. We will probably be
  in human trials beginning in 2015,” he told Reuters.


“We don’t have data indicating whether ZMapp is safe in
  humans, we don’t have data that it works in humans. That is the
  whole point of performing clinical trials,” he added.

Other drugs are also being tested in the hopes that a more
  comprehensive view of their benefits and consequences can be
  determined by the end of the year.


On Wednesday, WHO director general Margaret Chan said the virus
  has been “underestimated” by international
  organizations and is only getting worse.


“All international organizations underestimated the
  disease,” she said. “The outbreak will get worse before
  it gets better. And it requires a well-coordinated, big surge and
  huge scale-up of outbreak response urgently.”
