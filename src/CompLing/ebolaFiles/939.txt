 PlayThomas Levy, MD - Vitamin C Past, Present, Future Applications-cure to all known virus, bacterial infections.MrBetonmike 

On August 3 Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD wrote an article in NaturalHealth365 entitled Surprising solution for Ebola virus. In it he states, "Whether the infectious disease branch of modern medicine is truly unaware or just does not want to admit they are completely wrong on how to cure a viral syndrome remains a debatable point. Certainly, their “find a vaccine for everything” approach to viruses is not the answer." The Ebola virus disease, as is the case with viral hemorrhagic disease in general, resembles features of acute scurvy. Vitamin C is well known to have a broad range of benefits, including immune-boosting and antiviral properties, with an incredibly high safety margin.  Everything from the common cold to cancer can’t resist the healing power of vitamin C. hangthebankers.com

Thomas E. Levy, has been a practicing physician for 25 years, is a board-certified internist and a fellow of the American College of Cardiology. Dr. Levy is also an attorney. And if that isn't enough, he’s also a very fine writer. He has a new book, Vitamin C, Infectious Diseases, and Toxins: Curing the Incurable in which he boldly uses the word "cure." Dr. Levy believes that, "Unquestioning faith in the 'established' medical knowledge is so deeply ingrained that many doctors simply will not even consider reading something that comes from sources that they do not consider worthy of producing new medical concepts. And if they do…they quickly dismiss it as just being ridiculous if it conflicts with too many of the concepts that most of their colleagues and textbooks embrace."
Hollywood has contributed its own version of hysteria in both TV and movies with the many stories of killer epidemics that are somehow eradicated just in the nick of time to assure the happily-ever-after ending. Government health organizations are just as bad. They love scaring the pubic with doomsday reports. WHO chief Margaret Chan said the Ebola epidemic is out of control. “The virus attacks the body’s soft tissues — a process some doctors describe, bluntly, as like watching a patient ‘dissolve,” Tribune correspondent Paul Salopek reported during a 2000 outbreak, "There is no cure. No effective treatment. No vaccine. The rest of the world, a plane ride or two away, shudders. As with previous outbreaks, the virus shows no mercy. Ebola kills up to 90 percent of its victims with astonishing swiftness.” Sound familiar?
In spite of what you've heard, the Ebola virus can be destroyed naturally. According to Dr. Levy, "To date, not a single virus has been tested that is not inactivated (killed) by a large enough dose of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is both very potent and optimally bioavailable in accessing any viral infection." He also states, "The effects of vitamin C in “mopping up” after it inflicts its viral damage are further supported by its potent and multifaceted support of the immune system. There is no other substance that singularly does as much to promote increased and strong immune function as vitamin C. Among many other effects, vitamin C directly stimulates interferon and antibody production, while effectively supercharging the functions of the white blood cells by becoming very concentrated inside those cells."
Dr. Levy is not alone in his belief in the curative abilities of Vitamin C. The first physician to aggressively use vitamin C to cure diseases was Frederick R. Klenner, M.D. Beginning back in the early 1940's, Dr. Klenner consistently cured chicken pox, measles, mumps, tetanus and polio with huge doses of vitamin C. You would think it would difficult to ignore such success, but it has been done. Dr. Klenner wrote: "Some physicians would stand by and see their patient die rather than use ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) because in their finite minds it exists only as a vitamin." 
According to the late Dr Robert Cathcart, MD, who had extensive experience treating deadly infections with high dose vitamin C, “The Ebola virus kills by way of free radicals which can be neutralized by massive doses of sodium ascorbate intravenously.” Dr. Cathcart successfully treated over 20,000 patients with very large doses of vitamin C, sometimes administering over 150,000 mg per day.
Dr. Ronald Hunninghake is an internationally recognized expert on vitamin C who has personally supervised more than 60,000 intravenous (IV) vitamin C administrations. When asked why conventional medicine has not caught on to vitamin C he states, "I'm sure there are several factors here. Number one, most people think of vitamin C as a vitamin. You define vitamin as a trace amount of a substance that you need to prevent [ailments like] scurvy, in the case of vitamin C. But what we're talking about here is something in a pharmacological range." He also feels that there are there are also financial factors. The standard treatments are extremely expensive while I.V. vitamin C is relatively inexpensive. And conventional medicine, as a general rule, is notoriously uninterested in solutions that can't produce profits.
Dr. Hunninghake's statement is probably closer to the truth than they would like us to believe. In 2009 Tulane University Ebola researchers received more than a $7 million dollar grant from NIH (National Institute of Health) to fund the detection kits allegedly used in Sierra Leone. A 2007 Tulane University release entitled New Test Moves Forward to Detect Bioterrorism Threats boasts of an earlier $3.8 million NIH grant that led to early test trial success of “diagnostic test kits that will aid in bioterrorism defense against a deadly viral disease.
An article by Joachim Hagopian entitled The Ebola Virus Pandemic: “A Weapon of Mass Destruction”? states, "What is most certain in all these developing stories is the rapid unfolding of global destabilizing events and developments, bogus accusations and boldface lies streaming forth everyday from the propaganda mills of mainstream media and the US government. But a closer examination of what is far more probable, the actual truth indicates that so many of these simultaneous incidents are intimately related, and a mere connecting of dots spells an evil agenda promoting tighter control by a desperate security state that is now declaring war on all people who seek and speak the truth." Which is why the cure of vitamin C will be buried and vaccines will be promoted.
