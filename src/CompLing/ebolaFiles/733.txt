A civil society organisation, Civil Society Awareness Response on Epidemic Diseases (CARED) has warned health workers in all hospitals across the country not to reject patients with Ebola related symptoms just as they called for the fumigation of all public places in the country.The co-ordinator of the organisation, Mr Stephen Aremu who lamented the rate at which the deadly virus spreads, called on the Federal Ministry of Health to embark on air spray as a means of preventing the deadly Ebola virus in most parts of the country.He urged the Federal Ministry of Health to embark on air spray adding that government should consider the possibility of preventing hunting expedition in the country.Still on the rejection of patients with Ebola related symptoms, he said: “we are amazed at reports of several patients being refused treatment when found with Ebola symptoms when the right response should have been to notify the relevant authoritiesabout such suspicions than to send them back into the community.”“The consequences of sending such persons back to the communities untreated and uncared for are best imagined if any of the persons affected are truly infected with Ebola virus,” he added. Stay up to date, follow us on Twitter; @LeadershipNGA
