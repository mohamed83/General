Last week, President Obama called the Ebola epidemic in West Africa "a threat to global security."
Disease is disruptive, to a person and to a polity. This was especially true of Philadelphia during the stifling summer of 1793.
Within three months of the outbreak of a mysterious illness, more than 5,000 residents had perished. Symptoms included high fever, nausea, "black vomit," and jaundice. Yellow fever, as the disease became known,  eventually claimed one-tenth of the city's population, making it one of the deadliest epidemics in U.S. history.
Like Ebola, the yellow fever virus and vector originated in Africa, crossing the Atlantic via the slave trade. Mosquitoes, those  pestilential handmaidens, then spread the disease.


		
In an era preceding knowledge of the etiological link between mosquitoes and illness, Philadelphia and its physicians were unsure  how to treat and prevent yellow fever.
Many, including Benjamin Rush, believed the outbreak was a result of poor sanitary conditions, in particular the city's water systems. He also believed African Americans were immune to yellow fever, encouraging many to volunteer as nurses and porters.
His hypothesis proved false; many African Americans perished while assisting Rush. Yet because of their heroic service, many regard this as a formative event in the history of black Philadelphia.
Striking Philadelphia when the city  was  the capital of Pennsylvania and of the United States, the 1793 epidemic is partly responsible for the city's relative decline in relation to other port cities such as New York.
The outbreak did lead to a number of positive changes in the city. Perhaps most monumentally, Benjamin Latrobe, the "father of American architecture," designed Philadelphia's Water Works and water system to combat waste seeping into public wells.
The Historical Society of Pennsylvania will host a teacher workshop Saturday on innovative and interdisciplinary ways to teach about Philadelphia's yellow fever epidemic, and there will  be a lecture on the topic Oct. 23. Visit hsp.org to register.
