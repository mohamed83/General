Steve VanRoekel, the chief information officer at the White House, is leaving his post to help coordinate the administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa.The former Microsoft executive will be tasked with coordinating and ensuring the efficiency of the U.S. government’s efforts to fight the virus, an administration official said. VanRoekel will be a senior adviser to Rajiv Shah, the administrator for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and work as chief innovation officer at the agency. He will leave the Office of Management and Budget on Friday. The official did not say whether VanRoekel would travel to Africa.

VanRoekel’s background working with emerging technologies and open data is expected to come into play.

“Technology is not the solution to this extremely difficult task but it will be a part of the solution and I look forward to partnering with our Federal agencies, non-profit organizations and private sector tech communities to help accelerate this effort,” VanRoekel said in a statement.
Shah noted in a statement that “Steve transformed the way the federal government embraces innovation, and enabled USAID to become more efficient and effective” in past projects.
“With his unique talents and expertise, Steve will help us harness technologies like open data and mobile platforms to reach communities and households with powerful and life-saving information to help stop the devastating Ebola outbreak,” he added.

Some technology has already had an impact in affected areas. The CDC has distributed a mobile app with diagrams to help field workers understand the outbreak and its spread. And CDC also offers automated tools that help health workers speed up data analysis and track contacts of people who have contracted Ebola.
The latest numbers from the World Health Organization show more than 5,000 reported cases of the disease in West Africa, with more than 2,600 deaths.
While much of the administration’s response to the outbreak has been led by the military, President Barack Obama called on USAID earlier this week to distribute information, as well as prevention and treatment kits, to 400,000 households in the most affected areas of Liberia. In a Tuesday speech, Obama described the situation as a “potential threat to global security” and pledged to deploy a joint-force command of military medical personnel in Liberia. Military engineers also will help build 17 new medical centers in West Africa.
(Also on POLITICO: Editorials: Waking up to Ebola crisis)
The departure will leave the administration without a chief information officer, and the official said the president will “work to swiftly fill this very important role with another top talent.” The next CIO will work with OMB and White House leadership, including Megan Smith, the administration’s new chief technology officer.
Lisa Schlosser, a deputy administrator, will serve as interim CIO and oversee the Office of E-Government & Information Technology.
VanRoekel spent 15 years as a technologist and executive at Microsoft before he joined the Obama administration in 2009 as managing director of the Federal Communications Commission under former Chairman Julius Genachowski. Before joining OMB, VanRoekel helped coordinate USAID’s digital communications efforts as it responded to the 2011 crisis in the Horn of Africa.
