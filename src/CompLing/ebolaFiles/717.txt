Today, diseases and illnesses are better understood, managed and treated than at any prior point in human history. This is why it’s so disturbing that medicine, in one critical way, is getting ever closer to being dealt a giant blow. Antibiotics, which have saved countless millions from the specter of death and disability from bacterial infections, are losing their effectiveness, and the manner in which livestock and poultry are raised on many factory farms is a significant part of the problem.Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that bacteria are increasingly resistant to antibiotics that are widely used in food-producing animals. Unfortunately, a federal appeals court ruling on July 24 gave the Food and Drug Administration a pass on taking action, ruling that the FDA does not have to consider banning the practice of feeding antibiotics to healthy, food-producing livestock.Inaction, given the risks, is unacceptable. In its recent report on antimicrobial resistance, the World Health Organization said: “A post-antibiotic era in which common infections and minor injuries can kill — far from being an apocalyptic fantasy — is instead a very real possibility for the 21st century.”The WHO report is just the latest in a string of increasingly dire warnings from the medical community. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, said: “If we are not careful, we will soon be in a post-antibiotic era, and for some patients and some microbes, we are already there.” The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association and others agree.What does such a post-antibiotic future look like? Already there are 23,000 deaths each year from antibiotic-resistant infections, according to the CDC. And public health experts are in agreement: If we don’t act, the problem will only get worse. Pharmaceutical research and development is unable to keep ahead of the evolution of resistance.Meningitis and bacterial pneumonia may once again become wholly untreatable. Simple infections from cuts and scrapes may lead to amputations or death. The risks from chemotherapy and radiation therapy, both important cancer therapies, may prove too great because they weaken the immune system and make patients susceptible to infections. Surgeries from hip replacements to heart surgery may need to be put off or avoided for fear of infections. The list goes on.It was in 1928 that Alexander Fleming stumbled upon the curative effects of penicillin. It didn’t take long for researchers and the medical community to understand that resistance naturally follows the introduction and widespread use of an antibiotic. It’s for this reason that doctors are naturally judicious about prescribing an antibiotic.However, such caution does not always exist on large livestock and poultry operations. When factory farms discovered that their animals would exhibit faster growth when receiving antibiotics, many began placing antibiotics right into the daily feed of healthy animals. Additionally, antibiotics are used indiscriminately to prevent future illness. The shortsighted reasoning is that keeping animals on antibiotics for the duration of their lives is better than treating them once they’re ill.The result of this near-constant exposure to antibiotics? Bacteria mutate and some develop resistance. The more that bacteria are exposed to a drug, the faster this happens. And once resistance develops, the problem spreads, rapidly, as bacteria reproduce in minutes and swap the genes that confer resistance with each other.To prevent the World Health Organization’s fear of a post-antibiotic future from becoming a reality, we need to stop the spread of superbugs — and that means ending the misuse and overuse of antibiotics.If we want a future in which antibiotics remain a viable part of the toolbox of medicine — an effective route to treat serious infectious diseases, then we need action. We call upon the Obama administration — specifically the FDA — to prohibit livestock and poultry operations from injudiciously using antibiotics on healthy animals. Anything less is too little and endangers the health and well-being of us all.Dr. Dipesh Navsaria is a pediatrician and the treasurer of the Wisconsin chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Bruce Speight is the director of WISPIRG, the Wisconsin Public Interest Research Group. www.wispirg.org.

(One of the authors here): It would seem that the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons would at least partially support you in their 2013 statement: http://www.aaos.org/news/aaosnow/jan13/cover1.asp Keep in mind standard of practice was different for a long time, though, so it can take some time for people to change.  The cardiac guidelines changed a few years ago and it was difficult convincing many patients that they didn't need to antibiotics after they had been using it prior to dental work for many years.  There are genuine, valid reasons for prevention in certain circumstances, but as medicine has advanced, we've learned that it's not quite as broadly necessary as was once thought.Having said that, antibiotic use as prophylaxis prior to dental work doesn't cause resistance issues anything like it does in animal feed.  It's simply a magnitude issue.  Even 3-4 rounds of pre-dental antibiotics per year in a relatively small subset of humans is nothing compared to the large numbers of livestock receiving antibiotics daily in their feed.  (Not minimizing your concerns, just pointing out the magnitude of the difference.)

It's not just animals. I've got an artificial knee, and my dentist keeps wanting me to take antibiotics prior to every dental exam on the teeny, tiny, off chance that some bug will migrate from the linings of my teeth into my knee, cause an infection, and expose them to a lawsuit. I'm sure their lawyers put them up to it, because there is no medical reason for this whatsoever. I adamantly refuse to take the antibiotics and keep haranguing them to change their policy for everyone else as well, so far to no avail.

Does the Supreme Court's delay of implementing Voter ID law until after the November election change anything?




Yes. It makes the voting process fair to all.





Yes. It means Scott Walker won't win with ease.





No. The number of people affected is pretty minimal.





No. The results of the election would be the same either way.
