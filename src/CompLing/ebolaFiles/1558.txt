               00:00  According to the CDC the 2014 a beloved virus outbreak
               00:03  is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and the first Ebola
               00:07  epidemic the world has ever known and it's affecting multiple countries.
               00:11  Other risk of an outbreak here in the US is very
               00:14  low the CDC is taking precautions to prevent this from happening.
               00:17  Doctor Melissa Kennedy a virologist. At the UT college of veterinary
               00:21  medicine joining us now to talk more about Ebola. -- very
               00:26  interesting it especially the current status being called an epidemic. We
               00:31  were just talking was first discovered zone back in 1976. --
               00:36  -- first emerged into the human population back in 1976. In
               00:40  the Congo and in deep in the heart of Africa. Up
               00:45  until this point the outbreaks have been sort of minimal that
               00:48  would be a few cases sometimes a couple of hundred cases
               00:52  in the outbreak would be contained that this one has exceeded
               00:56  all. Expectations. In terms of spread amongst them. -- you know
               01:02  residents of western Africa. And that's primarily reversing their right nearly
               01:06  Agassi inching up to almost 6000 cases now yen nearly 6000
               01:10  people have been affected in nearly 3000 people have died so
               01:14  this is one really nasty Clarence -- let's talk about how
               01:17  it's transmitted. Well luckily it's not highly contagious it's not spread
               01:22  like the flu through the air. It is spread from person
               01:26  to person through direct contact with body fluids. Best tight close
               01:31  contact for transmission to a car. So we don't see aerosol
               01:36  spray it with this virus that is scary dangerous exceedingly dangerous
               01:40  high mortality rates to very anywhere from fifty to 90%. So
               01:46  in the human population. Which is not the natural hosts for
               01:49  the virus it is highly lethal. He sent out a natural
               01:53  host a lot of people out there may wonder can their
               01:55  pets people. Know dogs and cats horses. Are not susceptible. Tuesday
               02:02  Ebola Virus only prime mates including humans appear to be susceptible
               02:07  to the disease. And I missed something you're watching closely being
               02:11  involved and -- and just hopefully. They can get it under
               02:14  control. It's a scary prospect that it has been so out
               02:19  of control in this region in fact the cases are accelerating
               02:23  at this point. All right thank you so much doctor Melissa
               02:26  Kennedy it. Virologist at UT college of engineering that lesson is
               02:30  anything like that sure no problem right we're coming right back
               02:32  at us.More Videos:
