What is iatrogenesis?  And why isn’t it the most common word in politics?

Posted on March 2, 2012 by Wayne  

Friends,
I had a friend post on FaceBook about a politically motivated advertisement.  Ironically, the ad did NOT point out what iatrogenesis is.  It did allude to it.
Iatrogenesis means that more people die from it than from cigarettes.  More people die from it than die from heart attacks.
‘It’ is the LEADING cause of death in America.  ‘It’ is what no one wants to speak about.
‘It’ is not cheap – ‘it’ is very expensive.
But, ‘it’ is what your president wants you to spend trillions of dollars on.
‘It’ is a pipe dream.
‘It’ is why AIDS is killing more people without AIDS than die from AIDS.
‘It’ is medicine.
Death by medicine is ‘iatrogenesis.’  And it is the leading cause of death in America.
The cost of every life extended by the Obamanation called health care is about One Million Dollars.  And for every ten lives extended, NINE will be sacrificed to the god of ‘iatrogenesis.’
I have suffered from ‘iatrogenesis.’  I was ‘lucky,’ I lived.  But, it has marred my life.  And it is permanent.
Do you want to be one of the nine?
