However, he gave his assurance that the Health Department will monitor closely for the virus and that the people need not panic following the report that a foreign student at a private institution of higher learning is being quarantined at the Sarawak General Hospital (HUS).

He said the finding was made after laboratory tests were done on clinical samples taken from the student yesterday at the Sungai Buloh National Public Health Laboratory (MKAK) and found to be negative for Ebola virus.

Noor Hisham said the student from Zimbabwe had been in Malaysia since February and was quarantined for fever, sore throat and cough since September 13.

"This is a standard operating procedure where hospital staff are taking precautions. "The student has no history of international travel records nor had he come into contact with an Ebola patient in the past 21 days before showing the symptoms," he told Bernama today.
