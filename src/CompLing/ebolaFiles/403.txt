Ships advised on how to deal with Ebola risk

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) has provided a protocol for commercials ships encountering boatloads of migrants from parts of Africa affected by the Ebola virus.
Depending on the area, preventive measures might differ, however "in places like Liberia, which have recently identified a national emergency, our advice [to the ship] would be not to get involved as you would be putting the crew at risk in a confined place", ICS told IHS Maritime.
"There would be a responsibility on port states to manage the situation, so it would be more for national navies and resources. Should the crew identify such vessels they should contact the navy in the area to seek advice and get them airlifted rather, if necessary," said ICS.
International ship suppliers such as Hutton's Group also provide assistance by highlighting a range of medical protective equipment available for use in pandemic situations and advise ship operators on what measures to take to prioritise the health of their crew.
"We have noticed a greater awareness about illness control and prevention on board vessels since the outbreak. Protective measures are very necessary. Vessels calling at a country affected should have strict protocols in place before arrival on how they intend to protect themselves," John MacDonald, general manager of Hutton's Medical, told IHS Maritime.
