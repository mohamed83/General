Book Description







We first meet Steve Church on a business trip in Bahrain where terrorists attempt to take over the hotel where he is staying. Using prior CIA training and tradecraft, Steve is able to blunt the attack until the police arrive. On the same day, the Director of the National Clandestine Service at the CIA calls to tell him that she wants to see him urgently. Steve, not knowing the nature of her interest, is conflicted. He is not wild about getting involved again with an overly bureaucratic CIA, and he knows that another CIA assignment would kill his relationship with his live-in girl friend Kella, a former French intelligence officer. Nevertheless, without being an adrenalin junky, he prefers the excitement of the CIA to working for West Gate, a defense contractor, where he is a fast tracker. Initially astonished and dejected that Steve will again risk his life to obtain information that policy makers will ignore, Kella is unable to change Steve's mind. Not willing to break off the relationship, Kella executes a mental somersault and recruits herself to go with Steve as his communicator.Meanwhile in Iran, the man who will become Steve's nemesis, Ali Mousavi, captures, interrogates and executes a scientist suspected of working for the CIA, the Great Satan's spy agency. He also orders a young American with uncertain loyalties, to Tehran from his home in California to work on a special project. Although Steve's father Marshall is now semi-retired from the CIA (does a spy ever retire?), he recruits an Iranian intelligence operative on a secret mission to the United States. Without a permanent presence in Iran, the CIA turns to Steve to handle the new agent (XYSENTINEL) in Tehran. Under business cover, Steve and Kella take over the case in Tehran. Their initial goal is to collect intelligence on Iran's nuclear plans and capabilities. Instead, they learn that Iran is preparing a massive cyber attack against the United States. Iran's theocracy, humiliated by the American Navy's control of the Persian Gulf, feels that anonymous cyber warfare is the card to play to force the Great Satan' to withdraw from the region. From the start, external factors begin to trump Steve's clandestine tradecraft. At stake is the future of the Middle East, the health of America's economy, and the lives of Steve and Kella. Today's headlines will take on an entirely new meaning after you read Satan's Spy.

Thrills and suspense in every page
May 15, 2012
 
By Jack Durish

 

Truth is not only stranger than fiction, but also more thrilling. Especially when it comes to spy craft. This why I ordinarily stay away from spy stories. I find that few authors can match the intrigue and thrill of true stories recounted by real spies. Fortunately, once in a while a person with actual experience in the intelligence community and a talent for writing, such as Ian Fleming, produces a novel that captures the essence of covert operations. André Le Gallo is another such author. His second novel, Satan's Spy, builds on the promise we saw in his first, Caliphate. He is an accomplished author who produces novels that surely will become classics of the genre.In Satan's Spy, Steve Church, an independent operative who we met in Caliphate, is recruited by the CIA to infiltrate Iran to retrieve information about the Islamic Bomb, information that is vital to the policy makers in Washington who are attempting to decide how to respond to the prospect of a nuclear device in the hands of an unstable Middle Eastern government. Inasmuch as any citizen of the Great Satan, America, would be viewed with great suspicion, Steve enters the country under the guise of a Canadian businessman seeking to sell his companies services.His lover, Kella, another familiar face from the Caliphate, accompanies him as his backup. Theirs is a tenuous relationship. Steve isn't certain of where he stands with Kella even though she voluntarily involves herself in this dangerous mission. Men are such fools, even the most daring of us.Steve's task is to make contact with XYSentinel, an asset recruited a few years earlier by Steve's father, himself a former CIA operative. Dealing with an asset who might renege on his "deal" at any moment only adds to the sense of danger that Steve faces working in a hostile nation whose leaders would happily torture and kill him after making a public spectacle of his capture.The author is able to inject a great sense of reality into the milieu of the story. His narrative is liberally spiced with first hand observations of the people and place. He himself had served there during some of the most turbulent times in Iranian-American relations. His plot progresses rapidly and logically to its thrilling conclusion. His characters are three dimensional. Most importantly, Steve's adversary is no bumbling radical fool. He is cunning, intelligent, and resourceful. He commands a cadre of willing and able cohorts who will quickly pounce on any sign of Steve's presence within their nation's borders and ferret him out quickly and efficiently. Indeed, these are men who will extend their reach to any corner of the world wherever they can inflict pain and suffering on any citizen of the Great Satan, especially its spies.Interestingly, there is one other aspect of this book that especially appeals to me. Not only was I entertained, but also I came away with a sense of having learned something about real spy craft as well as a part of the world infamous for its influence on our lives, potentially a source of great danger.I would classify this book as a must read.

A terrifying tale of torture and terrorism
January 15, 2012
 
By FCEtier

 Verified Purchase 

Recent headlines seemed to have been ripped from the pages of Andre Le Gallo's best selling second novel, Satan's Spy.  Iran's capture of a U.S. drone, hackers attacking American computers via surrogate computers from a third country, and, most recently, Iran's test firing of missiles in the Persian Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz, all lend credence to the prescient nature of Le Gallo's writing.  Armed with the experience and connections available to a former CIA operative, Le Gallo takes readers on a fast-paced, action-packed mission into Iran.Those who have read Le Gallo's first novel, The Caliphate, will remember the father-son team of Marshall and Steve Church. Marshall is a retired CIA agent and Steve works for a private company in the states with business ties to the CIA.  While not an agent himself, the younger Church's position provides a convenient cover for clandestine operations.  Early on readers get an example of how other cultures regard (and use) both torture and capital punishment.  Will this clear contrast to how both issues are viewed in the West foretell the fate of our hero?  While the world and the media observe the tenth anniversary of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp(Jan. 5, 2012), and debate both it's morality and effectiveness, readers of Satan's Spy can discover how it affects Steve Church and his companion(s).The plot develops with flashbacks to the `78-'79 revolution in Iran when the Shah lost power.  Events and participants from that time combine to drive the action as our young hero begins dual metaphorical chess matches with proven masters, both political and religious.  Will he be up to the task? Le Gallo's story takes place in what may sound to readers as a surrealistic nightmare-filled world conjured up by David Lynch.  General Michael V.Hayden, reigning Director of the CIA confirms in the introduction that Satan's Spy is "anchored in reality."  Hayden goes on to say that Le Gallo's work gives readers "more than a small edge in penetrating the meaning of current events."As we ponder current events, we also look back.  Was there a public outcry in the mid-forties over the internment of Japanese citizens that would approach the concerns raised today over Gitmo?  Does the culture of our enemy influence our response to the perceived threat?  Should it?  After reviewing Le Gallo's first book, The Caliphate, I interviewed him for his current publisher, Venture Galleries.  That interview is available HERE.In a follow-up conversation this week, I asked about the different approaches with dealing with enemies.Le Gallo:  The ways that we and our enemies wage war separate us by a 1000 years.  In combat, in the court room, and in our everyday lives we  exert every effort to give noncombatants the benefit of the doubt in keeping with the values of a democracy.  On the other hand, one of the mottos of the true believers on the other side is "Jihad is our way and dying for the sake of Allah is our highest hope."  In their culture human life is cheap and we should not expect to be treated better than they treat themselves.As this review is being written(Jan. 2012), Iran has issued a threat to the United States to keep our aircraft carrier out of the Persian Gulf.  I enthusiastically recommend Satan's Spy not only as an exciting read, but as an objective and revealing look at today's events in the Middle East. Read more ›

The Inside Story
March 20, 2012
 
By Caleb Pirtle

 

  I read today's newspaper with headlines about the festering crisis in Iran, the threat of war, the threat of a nuclear weapon, the threat of a Naval bockade, the threat of some unknown virus hacking into and shutting down an entire computer system. Then I read Andre le Gallo's novel, "Satan's Spy." There is little difference in the two. It's just that Andre le Gallo wrote the book before reality happened. It's as though he had a special insight into the troubled world around us. He did. Andre le Gallo is a former CIA operative who worked in the the shadows of the Middle East. He understands the people. He knows the cultures. He know where the hatred is buried and how quickly and unexpectedly it can erupt. He's played in that arena before. Andre le Gallo has written a tale of fiction. But, in today's chaotic world, fiction just may be our strongest reflection of truth. In "Satan's Spy," we follow Marshall and Steve Church into a clandestine world ruled by terror and terrorism in Iran. It is a mad world where torture is a way of life. The human condition is the least of anyone's concerns. Nightmares never end. Le Gallo writes wicked prose as he crawls inside the minds of a tyrants and terrorists. The story moves rapidly, the drama is sometimes suffocating, and the suspense is like a rope of tension that is slowly beginning to unravel. There have been lots of spy novels produced over the years. But none have captured the fear and dread behind today's current events with the power and the impact of "Satan's Spy." Andre le Gallo just may be the finest writer of political thrillers in the world.
