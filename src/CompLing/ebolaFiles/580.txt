According to reports, the vaccine, known as Tyvivac, was a preventive medicine for typhoid fever, which came in single and 10 dos...es. It was also gathered that the vaccine would be presented by Creative Ideas Limited (CIL), in partnership with a Vietnamese company, Dalat Vaccine Company (DAVAC). The vaccine, according to reports, was said to have led to a total eradication of typhoid attacks in Vietnam today. The Media Manager, CIL, Mr Titus Agbo, expressed belief that a similar  feat could be achieved in Nigeria, with the introduction of Tyvivac into the country’s health care delivery system. The vaccine, Agbo explained, would be affordable and provides a three-year immunity against the disease once it was taken.
