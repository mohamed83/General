Ebola scare: The woman is taken by ambulance to an isolation ward in Berlin




   




Six hundred people were quarantined inside a job centre in the German capital Berlin today after a West African woman collapsed showing signs of contracting the deadly eblola virus.

The woman showed up at the employment bureau in the city’s Pankow district displaying signs of a high fever.
An employee notified authorities and she was rushed to the Virchow Hospital where she is now in an isolation ward.
The city’s health authorities said: “The woman had collapsed in the job centre and emergency medical services were called.”
Berlin”s fire department, which oversees medical emergencies, said: “An initial assessment determined that the patient was showing symptoms of ebola and the paramedics put in place quarantine measures.”
All 600 people quarantined within the centre were in the suspected victim’s vicinity before she collapsed as reports indicated she had been in contact with ebola victims in her homeland.

The latest scare came as the World Health Organisation said cases in West Africa’s ebola outbreak
rose to 2,240, including 1,229 deaths.

Quarantined: Job seekers and employees waits for permission from police to leave




The WHO
said it was working with the UN’s World Food Programme to try to get food to a million people in the ebola quarantine zones in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. 
“Food has been delivered to hospitalised patients and people under quarantine who are not able to leave their homes to purchase food," the WHO said."Providing regular food supplies is a potent means of limiting unnecessary movement,” 
The WFP is stepping up emergency food deliveries to the quarantined areas, which include severely-affected cities such as Gueckedou in Guinea, Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone and Foya in Liberia.

Meanwhile, Liberia has found all 17 suspected Ebola patients who fled a quarantine centre in the capital Monrovia at the weekend
and transferred them to another clinic. 
The patients fled when a holding facility was ransacked by an armed gang on Saturday night, raising fears that the deadly virus might spread into the densely populated slum surrounding it.
