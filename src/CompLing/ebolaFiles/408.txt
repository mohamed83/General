Tanker owners, charterers, disagree on Ebola liability

The outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa has yet to impact on oil tanker rates as owners and charterers are disagreeing on the liability extent.
A Singapore-based broker told IHS Maritime, "So far, the freight rates for West Africa-China have not seen any meaningful changes, although there's been a drop for West African crude shipments to India. Ship owners have to do what they can to prevent their ships from being quarantined."
IHS Maritime was shown Dutch commodity trader Trafigura's charter contract, which stated it would issue alternative voyage orders for any chartered-in tanker should the owners decide against entering any port due to Ebola.
The Dutch trading house said it would cover incurred expenses up to the completion of cargo discharge or for up to 30 days from the departure from an Ebola-stricken port (whichever is later).
Another Singapore-based broker told IHS Maritime that, "Some owners are asking for charterers to be liable for up to 45 days but that's too long for many charterers."
Several ports are quarantining ships from afflicted areas, granting access only after the crew do not show Ebola symptoms. Freight rates for West Africa-China averaged Worldscale 46.31 or $26,638/day yesterday, up 0.48 points from Monday, while those for West Africa-US averaged W53.54 or $30,314/day.
Meanwhile West Africa-EC India rates fell from $4.25M (lump-sum basis) last week to $3.9M today. Brokers described activity as soft. "So far, what we've seen are Unipec fixing some tankers and a few Indian charterers taking some cargoes too. Nothing much so far," said the second broker.
