U.S. Assistance in Ebola Outbreak Continues to Reach Liberia













U.S. Assistance in Ebola Outbreak Continues to Reach Liberia
20 September 2014




Operation United Assistance is not led by the military, Kirby said, noting that in this case, DoD is supporting the U.S. Agency for International Development, the State Department and the Liberian government. 

By Cheryl Pellerin | DoD News

A version of this news article was published to the Defense Department website September 19.


The increased U.S. assistance 
President Barack Obama announced this week has begun to arrive in 
Liberia, one of the West African countries hardest-hit by the deadly 
Ebola virus disease outbreak, Pentagon press secretary Navy Rear Admiral
 John Kirby said here September 19.
Army Major General Darryl A. Williams, the U.S. Army Africa commander
 who will lead the U.S. military's response dubbed Operation United 
Assistance is now in Liberia, Kirby said.
“He arrived in Monrovia two days ago with a 12-person assessment team
 [that] is conducting on-the-ground planning and site surveys to 
construct Ebola treatment units in Liberia,” the admiral told reporters 
at a news conference.
At the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on 
September 16, Obama announced that U.S. Africa Command would set up a 
joint force command headquarters in the Liberian capital to support U.S.
 military activities and to help in coordinating expanded U.S. and 
international relief efforts to fight the Ebola outbreak — the worst in 
history.
Kirby said C-17 aircraft carrying military handling equipment arrived in Monrovia yesterday.
WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT EFFORT
“The aircraft offloaded a heavy-duty forklift, a generator and a crew
 of seven military personnel to quickly assess the capacity and payload 
of the runways at Roberts International Airport,” he said, adding that 
the equipment would help to provide general support for the U.S. 
whole-of-government response going forward.
“We anticipate that two C-17s will arrive in Liberia this weekend 
with approximately 45 additional U.S. military personnel,” the admiral 
said, “and they will begin work establishing the command headquarters of
 General Williams.”
Kirby said the assessment team also will evaluate what other deployed
 U.S. military personnel will need in terms of support infrastructure to
 sustain operations for up to six months, “or however long U.S. military
 assistance is required” in West Africa.
Williams and U.S. Ambassador to Liberia Deborah Malac have met with 
Liberian officials, including President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to 
discuss the increased U.S. response to the Ebola crisis. They also have 
toured several sites where more Ebola treatment units will be built, 
Kirby said.
“Currently, program funds approved for the DoD Ebola response are 
around $30 million,” the admiral explained, adding that this includes 
previously announced efforts such as a 25-bed mobile hospital for ill 
African health care workers, supplies and lab training, diagnostic 
equipment, and personal protective equipment.
REQUEST TO REPROGRAM FUNDS
So far, DoD has requested to reprogram two rounds of $500 million 
each in fiscal year 2014 overseas contingency funds to provide urgent 
humanitarian assistance to fight Ebola, Kirby said, noting that DoD is 
prepared to devote up to $1 billion to its Ebola response efforts.
“We’re still working through all the planning processes to determine 
future requirements and resources,” he told reporters, “and we expect 
additional personnel and materials to continue flowing to the affected 
area over the next several weeks and months.”
In response to questions, Kirby said there “is no intention right now
 that [deployed troops] will interact with patients or be in areas where
 they would necessarily come into contact with patients.”
He added, “They're not doctors. They're not nurses. They're not 
trained for that and not equipped for that. That's not part of the 
mission. They will be kept in locations where they can do their jobs 
without coming into contact with patients.”
The troops will be acting in support of health care workers who are the experts at treating patients, he explained.
“A key component of moving our troops anywhere in any situation is to
 make sure that we adequately prepare them, train them and equip them 
for their own personal protection,” he explained.
CLEAR-EYED ABOUT RISK
Kirby said the department is clear-eyed about the risk it’s incurring
 in standing up the mission in Liberia with a deadly disease.
“The disease itself is the threat. We understand that,” he said. “We 
get paid to deal in risk and to manage that and to mitigate it the best 
we can. It's difficult in any military operation to eliminate it, and 
the men and women who sign up and serve in the military understand that 
when they do.”
Operation United Assistance is not led by the military, Kirby said, 
noting that in this case, DoD is supporting the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, the State Department and the Liberian 
government.
“We have unique capabilities,” the admiral said. “We try to stay as 
ready and prepared across those capabilities as we can. And if there 
should be a need in the future to change the mission, to modify it 
somewhat, then we'll have that discussion. But there's no discussion 
about that right now.”
