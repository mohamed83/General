He had flown to Liberia shortly after Mrs Writebol and another aid worker were infected."We don't have enough personal protective safety equipment to adequately be able to safely diagnose if a patient has Ebola," David Writebol said, adding Ebola has "overwhelmed the supply chain"."They can't get equipment in because there aren't any regular flights coming in. Same thing with aid workers from the international community."Nurses in Liberia's largest hospital are on strike, refusing to return to work until they are issued with protective equipment.Dr Sacra went into isolation after his temperature rose, but was well enough on Wednesday to be sending emails, a spokesperson for his aid organisation, SIM, said.Ebola is only spread through close contact but there is no cure for the infection. The fatality rate for this outbreak has been almost 50%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has called for the international community to step up its response, specifically a $490m (£298m) appeal from the WHO.The US Agency for International Development (USAID) which has directed the US response, has airlifted medical emergency supplies, including chlorine and gloves, to Liberia."The window of opportunity to stop Ebola from spreading widely throughout Africa and becoming a global threat for years to come is closing, but it is not yet closed," Dr Tom Frieden, who recently returned from West Africa, said in a statement"If the world takes the immediate steps - which are direct requests from the frontlines of the outbreak and the presidents of each country - we can still turn this around."His comments echo similar criticism by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, who have said world leaders' response has been "lethally inadequate".﻿Third American with Ebola named.8 photosJean Bosco Sibomana's photos1Add a comment...
