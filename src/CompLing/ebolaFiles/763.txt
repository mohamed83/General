 On behalf of UOC (Open University of Catalunya) and the Hands-On ICT project (EU funded project from the Lifelong Learning programme www.handsonict.eu), we  would like to inform about an upcoming MOOC on teacher training. The main aim of this course is to support educators in the design and adaptation of lessons or  learning activities that include the use of ICT tools. It is a practical and hands-on oriented MOOC during which educators will create a learning activity ready to be use in their educational scenarios afterwards.   Here are some reasons for joining this MOOC:  – take part of the first MOOC to be facilitated in 7 languages (English, Spanish, Catalan, French, Slovenian, Greek and Bulgarian)  – learn about ICT tools for learning and teaching  – learn how to apply the Learning Design Studio approach  – design a learning activity for your teaching activities ready to be implemented in your lessons  – try the beneficies of peer-mentoring, both as a mentor and a mentee  – benefit of the help of a team of international facilitators  – be part of a worldwide community interested in ICT in education  – try new learning tools such as Canvas, ILDE, Hangouts and others   The MOOC is free of charge and will start on October 27th. It lasts 5 weeks. By the end of it you will receive a certificate of participation and a set of badges compatible to be added on the Mozilla Backpack.

This study aimed at assessing skills deficits in developing country contexts on the basis of firm data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys. A precise definition of skills deficit was used – employers’ perceptions of inadequate workforce a educational levels as a relative and absolute constraint to firm growth and performance - to assess the relevance of skills deficits in a set of 25 low- and middle-income countries. Although limited to the formal sector and to employer perceptions, the study nonetheless highlights a number of patterns concerning skills deficits in the development world of relevance for policy.http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002178/217890e.pdf

The financial and economic crisis shattered the Lisbon Strategy’s attempt to increase the EU’s employment rate to 70% among 15-64 year old by 2010. The new Europe 2020 strategy envisages a 75% adult employment rate by 2020; however, this goal also seems unrealistic in light of the economic crisis which has caused the EU’s employment rate to drop significantly below 70%. A crucial question now is whether a skill upgrade of the European labour force would help to increase the employment rate, especially among youth. This Forum explores the relationship between education and employment throughout the EU.

This paper relies on randomized assignment of the entrepreneurship track to identify impacts on labor market outcomes one year after graduation. The analysis finds that the entrepreneurship track was effective in increasing self-employment among applicants, but that the effects are small in absolute terms. In addition, the employment rate among participants remains unchanged, pointing to a partial substitution from wage employment to self-employment. The evidence shows that the program fostered business skills, expanded networks, and affected a range of behavioral skills. Participation in the entrepreneurship track also heightened graduates' optimism toward the future shortly after the Tunisian revolution.http://ftp.iza.org/dp7079.pdf

				    						    			Canadian Vocational Association / Association canadienne de la formation professionnelle's insight:
				    						    	

New concerns in the field of skills development and certification put a target of training and certifying 500 million people by 2022 to cash in on the country’s demographic dividend and make India’s labour force globally competitive. Obviously, the bulk of this 500 million will be trained informally, and recognizing and certifying their skills is therefore crucial. Towards this end it is proposed to implement a National Vocational and Educational Qualification Framework (NVEQF) that would rationalize the Indian vocational training and certification system. It is envisaged that NVEQF will be able to tackle the existing problems of the system.http://norrag.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/indias-approach-to-the-certification-of-vocational-skills/See also India’s Approach to the Certification of Vocational Skillshttp://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Rashmi A Vocational_Skill_Certification_2.pdf

 How effective is your mentoring program?  What people are gaining from the mentoring?   Are there ways to improve the participant’s experience and outcomes?   With ever-increasing demands on resources, it is critical that mentoring is shown to have a positive impact on the organization that invests in it, as well as the people involved.   I’ve been helping organizations design and implement mentoring programs since 1994. I have worked with mentors and those who are mentored in Australia and overseas. I have reviewed many mentoring programs and seen what works and what doesn’t.   In this complimentary webinar you will discover the answer to three key questions:   What return on investment can reasonably be expected from mentoring?  Can you put "hard" measures on "soft" values?   What and how can you evaluate?

The report shows how education and training for prisoners help reduce the social costs of crime and support the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration into society. It further provides an overview of key European policies and funding programmes related to prison education and training, highlighting their added value and contribution to the development of innovative and new approaches to education provision in prisons. It then looks into the current ‘state-of-play’ with regard to provision in prisons across Europe, providing some concrete examples from individual Member States.http://ec.europa.eu/education/library/study/2013/prison_en.pdf

Adults have an active role in their own learning and training. Non formal and informal education is the cornerstone for a lifelong learning and career development. But related knowledge and skills, derived from several years of professional experience, personal development, or continuous vocational training, are hardly recognized in the formal education arena. Candidates for a diploma or qualification have to confront more or less referenced educational syllabus. For a better classification and promotion of individual knowledge and skills, and a more effective definition of associated competency proficiency levels, this paper investigates two approaches, supported with tools, so as to guide candidates in self-assessment and as such facilitate knowledge and skills validation by examination boards.http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/79/75/29/PDF/EDUCON2012_Rouvrais-ShortPaperFebruary2.pdf
