Lagos, Nigeria - Barely 24 hours before his death, Patrick Sawyer had a rather strange - and in the words of medical and diplomatic sources here, “Indiscipline” encounter with nurses and health workers at First Consultants Hospital in Obalende, one of the most crowded parts of Lagos, a population of some 21 million inhabitants, FrontPageAfrica has learned.Looking to get to the bottom of Sawyer’s strange ailment on the Asky Airline flight, which Sawyer transferred on in Togo, hospital officials say, he was tested for both malaria and HIV AIDS. However, when both tests came back negative, he was then asked whether he had made contact with any person with the Ebola Virus, to which Sawyer denied. Sawyer’s sister, Princess had died of the deadly virus on Monday, July 7, 2014 at the Catholic Hospital in Monrovia. On Friday, July 25, 2014, 18 days later, Sawyer died in Lagos.The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that the average incubation period for suspected cases or someone who has made contact with an Ebola patient is eight to ten days from exposure to onset of symptoms.  The range is from two to 21 days.  “That's why we recommend that contacts of an infected person go on a fever watch for 21 days,” says Stephan Monroe, deputy director of CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases, at a briefing Monday. ‘Against Medical Advice’Since the first report surfaced in March, there have been more than 1,201 cases reported and unfortunately 672 deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the CDC says.  “This is the largest Ebola outbreak in history and the first in West Africa.  It’s a rapidly changing situation and we expect there will be more cases in these countries in the coming weeks and months. The response to this outbreak will be more of a marathon than a sprint.”Back in Lagos, authorities at the First Consultants Hospital in Obalende decided that despite Sawyer’s denial, they would test him for Ebola, due to the fact that he had just arrived from Liberia, where there has been an outbreak of the disease with more than 100 deaths.The hospital issued a statement this week stating that Sawyer was quarantined immediately after he was discovered to have been infected with the deadly virus. In addition, a barrier nursing was implemented around Sawyer and the Lagos State Ministry of Health was immediately notified. Hospital authorities also requested the Federal Ministry of Health for additional laboratory test based on its suspicion of Ebola.FrontPageAfrica has now learned that upon being told he had Ebola, Mr. Sawyer went into a rage, denying and objecting to the opinion of the medical experts. “He was so adamant and difficult that he took the tubes from his body and took off his pants and urinated on the health workers, forcing them to flee.The hospital would later report that it resisted immense pressure to let out Sawyer from its hospital against the insistence from some higher-ups and conference organizers that he had a key role to play at the ECOWAS convention in Calabar, the Cross River State capital. In fact, FrontPageAfrica has been informed that officials in Monrovia were in negotiations with ECOWAS to have Sawyer flown back to Liberia.A text message in possession of FrontPageAfrica from the ECOWAS Ambassador in Liberia, responding to a senior GoL official reads: Your Excellency, the disease control department of the Federal Ministry of Health just contacted me through the hospital now, insisting that Mr. Sawyer be evacuated for now. Pls advise urgently.”LUTH Lab positive on EbolaFirst Consultants said that it then went further to reach senior officials in the Office of the Secretary of Health of the USA who assisted it with contacts at the Centre for Disease Control and W.H.O Regional Laboratory Centre in Senegal. According to the hospital, the initial results from LUTH laboratory showed a signal of possible Ebola virus, but required confirmation.The First Consultants statement noted that it was able to obtain confirmation of Ebola virus disease, (Zaire strain) after working with the state, federal and international agencies. Sawyer was pronounced dead at 6:50 AM Nigeria time, on July 25 and all agencies were properly notified.Once the case was officially confirmed, the hospital was temporarily shut down and in-house patients immediately evacuated. Sawyer’s body was subsequently cremated under W.H.O guidelines and witnessed by all appropriate agencies, according to the hospital statement. “In keeping with W.H.O guidelines, the hospital is shut down briefly as full decontamination exercise is currently in progress. The re-opening of the hospital will also be in accordance with its guidelines”, the hospital said.In the aftermath of Sawyer’s death, both federal and state authorities in Lagos have instituted measures to curb the spread of the disease and quarantining all those who came in contact with Sawyer.In total, Sawyer reportedly came in direct contact with 59 persons, 44 of whom were at the hospital he was taken to when he fell ill, according to the Lagos State government. The Lagos state government clarified in a statement Monday that Ms. Obi-Nnadozie, Nigeria’s Ambassador to Liberia was not among the 15 people at the airport who had had direct contact with Mr. Sawyer before his death as was initially believed.Ashes Returned to LiberiaHowever, it has been reported that Sawyer came in contact with three ECOWAS officials – a driver, a liaison officer and a protocol officer. Also in the list are two nursing staff and five airport handlers.Dr. Jide Idris, the Lagos State Health Commissioner, told a news conference this week that 20 per cent of those that came in contact with the deceased had been physically screened. “The private hospital (First Consultants Medical Centre) was demobilized and primary source of infection eliminated. The patient has been cremated and the ash will be transferred to the Liberian government whenever the need arises. Decontamination process in all affected areas has commenced,” Dr. Idris said.In the aftermath of Sawyer’s death, diplomatic, ECOWAS and medical authorities here are baffled over Sawyer’s deception, especially armed with new information that his sister, Princess had died of the deadly virus and his denial. Finance Ministry sources in Monrovia are in quiet murmur over what they feel was a letdown by Sawyer for not being forthcoming with his peers he worked with.The ministry has since been temporarily shut down and those who came in contact with Sawyer are on a 21-day forced incubation monitoring process. "All senior officials coming in direct or indirect contact with Mr. Sawyer has been placed on the prescribed 21 days of observatory surveillance," the ministry said in a statement this week.FrontPageAfrica has now learnt that Sawyer exhibited similar indiscipline behavior during his sister’s stay at the Catholic Hospital in Monrovia where she was taken because he noticed she was bleeding profusely and was later found to be a victim of Ebola.‘Indiscipline’ Sawyer, EJS SaysSawyer was seen with blood on his clothing after his sister’s death and had earlier demanded that she be placed in a private room. President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf cited indiscipline and disrespect as a key reason why Sawyer contracted the Ebola virus. She said his failure to heed medical advice put the lives of other residents across the nation’s border at risk.A disease which now claimed more than a hundred Liberians has now forced the Sirleaf-lead government to shut down the borders, schools and a host of other measures to ensure that the disease does not get out of hand, including a US$5 million initial contribution to begin the immediate implementation of this plan. “Our immediate strategy is to contain the spread, care for the afflicted with the goal of “No New Cases”,” Sirleaf told the nation in an address Wednesday. FrontPageAfrica has learned that the Ministry of Health is requesting US$20 million to combat the disease.In addition, the President has mandated that all non-essential staff, to be determined by the Minister or Head of Agency, are to be placed on a 30-day compulsory leave and Friday, August 1, is declared a non-working day and is to be used for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities. “All borders that are to remain opened are to be directly supervised and controlled by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization whose duties it shall be, working with the assigned health authorities, to ensure strict adherence to announce preventive measures including preliminary testing for fever. Without exceptions, all schools are ordered closed pending further directive from the Ministry of Education. All markets at border areas including Foya, Bo Waterside, and Ganta are hereby ordered closed until further notice.But despite the measures put in place by Liberia, the effect of Sawyer’s ‘indiscipline has already taken a toll. ASKY, the Pan-African airline ASKY on which Sawyer flew, has suspended all flights to and from Monrovia and Sierra Leone as has other regional carriers, Arik Air and Gambia Bird dealing a huge blow to commercial aviation.Linger Questions Over BehaviorBack in Monrovia, Samaritan Purse, the U.S. missionary group helping to treat Ebola patients is scaling down, announcing Wednesday, plans to evacuate nonessential personnel given the five-month-old outbreak is worsening as the fate of two Americans infected with the Ebola hang in the balance on hope and prayers.For Sawyer, questions are lingering over his behavior, both at the Catholic Hospital in Monrovia and the First Consultants in Lagos and what led him to behave the way he did. More importantly diplomatic observers here are puzzled over his demise: The timing and behavior. A few persons who spoke to Sawyer, including FrontPageAfrica reported that he sounded fine hours before his death. It is unclear what pushed him to the wall and why?As for the other eight members of the delegation that flew to Lagos, along with Sawyer, diplomatic sources in Lagos confirmed to FrontPageAfrica Wednesday that they were all checked and told to report to the Ministry of Health in Monrovia upon their arrival. It is unclear how close they were to Sawyer or whether authorities in Monrovia have begun monitoring them as the clock ticks on the recommended 21-day incubation period.http://frontpageafricaonline.com/index. ... ge-strange

IN the interest of our patients, staff, the general public and the nation at large we state the following:A 40-year old gentleman came into the hospital with symptoms suggestive of Malaria (fever, headache, extreme weakness) on Sunday night (20th July, 2014);He was fully conscious and gave us his clinical history and told us he is a Senior Diplomat from Liberia. Laboratory investigations confirmed malaria whilst other tests for HIV, Hepatitis B & C were negative. He was admitted and treatment commenced.However, due to the fact that he was not responding to treatment but rather was developing haemorrhagic symptoms we further questioned him. He denied having been in contact with any person with EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) at home, in any hospital or at any burial. In spite of this denial we immediately decided to do the following:1. To conduct further tests for possible infectious Haemorrhagic Disease, especially Ebola Virus Disease, based on the fact that he was a Liberian citizen and the recent outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in that country.2. We immediately isolated/quarantined the patient, commenced barrier nursing and simultaneously contacted the Lagos State Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry of Health to enquire where further laboratory tests could be performed as we had a high index of suspicion of possible Ebola Virus Disease.3.We refused for him to be let out of the hospital in spite of intense pressure, as we were told that he was a senior ECOWAS official and had an important role to play at the ECOWAS convention in Calabar, Cross River State.4.The initial test results from LUTH laboratory indicated a signal of possible Ebola Virus Disease, but required confirmation.5.We then took the further step of reaching out to Senior Officials in the office of the Secretary of Health of the United States of America who promptly assisted us with contacts at the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organisation Regional Laboratory Centre in Senegal.6.Working jointly with the State, Federal Agencies and International Agencies, we were able to obtain confirmation of Ebola Virus Disease (Zaire Strain), (W.H.O. Regional Centre Lab - Senegal/Redeemers Lab/LUTH Laboratory).7.The gentleman subsequently died on Friday at 6.50 a.m. (25th July, 2014);8.All agencies were promptly notified and in consultation with W.H.O. Regional Ebola Virus Disease Centre in Conakry, Guinea and Best Practices, the following was commenced:(a)Orderly temporary shut down of the hospital with immediate evacuation of in-house patients.(b)The appropriate professional removal of the body and its incineration under W.H.O. guidelines witnessed by all appropriate agencies9. Having concluded the above, it is now appropriate to give the Press release in the interest of our patient, staff, the general public and the nation at large.10.In keeping with W.H.O. guidelines, the hospital is shutdown briefly as full decontamination exercise is currently in progress. The reopening of the hospital will also be in accordance with W.H.O. guidelines.n conclusion, working with the State, Federal and International Agencies, we were able to identify and confirm the diagnosis of the Ebola Virus Disease.We hope that by our action of preventing this gentleman from being extracted from our hospital and travelling to Calabar we have been able to prevent the spread of Ebola Virus Disease in Nigeria.The Board and Management of the Hospital wish to thank all our staff members for their diligence and professionalism.Thank you.First Consultants Medical Centre Limited, 16/24 Ikoyi, Road, Obalende, Lagos.http://allafrica.com/stories/201407311324.html

How Patrick Sawyer Contracted Ebola 29.07.2014 | 19:57 PM On Friday U.S. citizen Patrick Sawyer died in Nigeria after collapsing at Lagos Airport as he returned from the funeral of his sister, who had also died from the disease.Cogent information accessed by the National Chronicle from the St. Joseph’s Catholic Hospital reveals that an undisciplined attitude led to the death of Patrick Sawyer on July 25, 2014 in Nigeria’s commercial city, Lagos; Monica Samuels reports.   A medical source revealed that Princess, Sawyer’s sister, was taken to the St. Joseph’s Catholic Hospital by her fiancé, after he noticed she was bleeding profusely. Princess’s fiancé (name withheld), a French-speaking individual, convinced the hospital’s medical director, Patrick Ndzande, who also speaks French, that his fiancée was suffering from a miscarriage.   Not being sure of the information he received from Princess’s fiancé, director Ndzande sent for the doctor-on-duty, a medical doctor from DR Congo. The Congolese doctor, who was well-protected, performed a D&C (dilation and curettage) on Princess, but the bleeding continued, which caused panic among the hospital staff; they transferred her to a general ward, the Chronicle source disclosed.   According to the source, it was after the nurses and staff of the hospital raised the concern that the bleeding was not caused by a miscarriage; rather, it was a symptom of another disease, Ebola, that the hospital’s authorities made the arrangement to send her to an isolated unit. But during that time, Patrick Sawyer entered.   Information has it that, after Sawyer entered the hospital, when his sister awaited a transfer to the isolation-unit, he argued that his sister would not be taken to the unit; instead, she should be taken to a private ward.   According to the Chronicle’s medical source, Sawyer personally undressed Princess, the suspected Ebola patient, changed her into a different set of clothes, placed her in a wheelchair, took her to a private room, and deposited US$500 for her care. The source said all the workers at the hospital were astonished by Sawyer’s behavior.   The Chronicle source disclosed that, while undressing his sister, her uncontrollable blood was seen on Patrick’s clothing, including his footwear. It was his brother-in-law who had to get him a pair of slippers, leaving the bloody footwear at the hospital.   Unfortunately, Princess was tested and confirmed with the Ebola virus; she died on July 7, 2014, and since, the private ward room where she was transferred has been closed, with her belongings and her brother’s footwear.   It can be recalled that President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf said indiscipline and disrespect led to Sawyer contracting the Ebola virus. She said his failure to heed to medical advice has put the lives of other residents across the nation’s border at risk.   Meanwhile, there are reports that Patrick Ndzande, the medical director at the St. Joseph’s Catholic Hospital who first came into contact with Sawyer’s sister, was infected with the Ebola virus, and is being quarantined.  - See more at: http://nationalchronicleliberia.com/new ...

30.07.2014 | 19:39 PM From what has been experienced over the last five months, certainly, one can conclude that the conviction of too many that Liberians do not take anything seriously is true, and it is the primary reason why the deadly hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, is now out of control in a population of just three million four hundred thousand people; writes Jah H. Johnson.    It is documented that the Ebola fever has been around for decades, surfacing in nations like Sudan, Zaire now DR Congo, Uganda, Kenya and even as close as Cote d’Ivoire, just next door. In most recent times, the 2000s, the virus resurfaced again in East African nations like Uganda, DR Congo and Kenya. This time around, Ebola became a household name in national and international arenas for the despicable manner it treats its victims.    Nations in the east African region, Uganda, DR Congo and Kenya, have successfully contained the vicious predator, not on one occasion, but several. It was at those times, analysts believe, that the government should have sent health experts to East Africa to learn the method used by those nations to contain the deadly disease.    East Africa may have been far away but experts believe that the very close association amongst Africans made it possible for the virus to one day reach this land. The problem with Liberians, they say, is that they take nothing seriously until it gets out of hand.    In February 2014, when the outbreak started in the Republic of Guinea, it was expected that government authorities would immediately take drastic measures to prevent the scourge from reaching Liberia. If it did reach, then contain it at the border areas.    Unfortunately, government said it could not close any border or take any drastic method because the problem was not an exigency. The government was wrong, analysts say. Dr. Walter Gwenegale and his team at the health ministry are all professional people; they should have been aware of the destructive ability of the Ebola virus and should have advised the government adequately. The team at the ministry is the health advisors to the President and the nation.    It was all due to the lackadaisical mentality and corruption that Liberians are succumbing to the deadly disease. This is what indiscipline and corruption does to any nation, a reputable nurse told the Chronicle. The only way to fight the virus is to use drastic measures as quarantining suspected populations early before it spirals out of control.    The fear of most is what will happen after this evil has decimated a large section of the hapless Liberian population. Its victims are primarily doctors and junior health workers, which the nation does not have in abundance. Because of the lack of adequate medical doctors and junior health workers, doctors have been brought in from other African nations and, even, China.    The Ebola virus, which is no respecter of person, is killing the very few doctors, nurses and other health workers. What will happen after this thing is finally contained but all the health practitioners are gone?    Information reaching the Chronicle says that the government is to institute drastic measures to help fight the scourge, now out of control. According to insiders, the government itself is now confused and has no answer to the problem. Experts say if these measures were taken earlier, probably the plague may not have gone this far. Dr. Samuel Brisbane would have been alive and still with us.    It is alleged that the government is about to deploy the military and armed police to quarantine highly suspicious communities and regulate the activities of the citizenry. Is this Marshall Law? Someone asked. Whether Marshall or not, government should do anything and everything possible to nip this ugly situation in the butt, another person said.    It was also alleged that the government is to close down all entertainment centers and sporting arenas, where people congregate, as a means of fighting the disease. Experts say all these are belated as the virus is now released in the general population. They say that the fever may vanquish hundreds, even thousands, before it is brought under control. Liberians, they say, should prepare for the worst before it gets better.    At present, this paper has been informed that the chief medical officer of the Catholic Hospital, Dr. Patrick Mshamdze, a Catholic brother and a Cameroonian national, has succumbed to the disease. Dr. Mshamdze bit the dust yesterday at the hospital, and his remains was still locked up in a hospital room up to press time.    Information says that those he came into contact with before he died includes Dr. Mohamed Mahmoud, an Egyptian, Dr. Rafael Senga, social worker, Tetee Dogba, nurse, Lourine Togba and others. The information says that after Dr. Mshamdze got ill, sisters Chantal and Patience convinced the health practitioners that he was not sick from Ebola, therefore they should take care of him. They cared for the doctor unprotected and may now be infected.    The Ugandan doctor, Dr. Sam, who passed from Ebola some days ago, as was reported in the Chronicle, was reportedly the boyfriend of the sister of Patrick Sawyer, Princess. Sawyer, who worked as special assistant to Minister Amara Conneh, died from Ebola at a hospital in Nigeria on July 25. News from Nigeria says that Sawyer’s body has been burnt and the hospital closed down.    Sawyer, who was in denial that his sister, Princess, was infected, told authorities at Catholic Hospital that she had a miscarriage; that is why she was hemorrhaging so much. It was Dr. Ruby, a Congolese who performed the D and C on Princess. After the procedure, the bleeding continued. This made the staff suspicious and tested her for Ebola.    Dr. Ruby is now quarantined and under observation at the hospital. Princess later died on July 7, and is highly suspected of infecting her brother, Patrick Sawyer. Princess, the girlfriend of Dr. Sam of Uganda, reportedly contracted the virus from her boyfriend because she was his caretaker during his time of illness.    Other reports in the office of the Chronicle tells of an unprecedented high number of bodies being buried daily at the Muslim graveyard, commonly called “Mandingo graveyard”, Gaye Town, Old Road. Residents in the area told the Chronicle that the bodies are buried in very shallow graves, which is not proper for their surroundings.    The residents say that there is a well in the community where most of the residents fetch water from, and the shallow burial of the multiple bodies for unsuspected causes of death may cause an epidemic in the area. Health experts say that the manner traditional people and Muslims handle their dead is a health risk; the Ebola disease can rapidly spread under such conditions.    Health experts from international agencies have concluded that the final containment of the disease could take as long as the end of the year. By that time, it is estimated that hundreds, or even thousands, could have met their demise. Nothing should be taken for granted.    During the middle ages, the bubonic plague, or Black Death, killed more than fifteen million people before receding. Let it not be for play. If Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and the West African region do not find a solution soon, the middle ages could repeat itself.     - See more at: http://nationalchronicleliberia.com/new ... lrCF4.dpuf

One of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola, a government official said on Sunday, and a second US healthcare worker has been infected in what the World Health Organisation (WHO) is calling the largest outbreak ever recorded of the disease.Dr Samuel Brisbane is the first Liberian doctor to die in an outbreak, which the WHO says has killed 129 people in the west African nation. A Ugandan doctor working in the country died this month.Brisbane, who once served as a medical adviser to the former Liberian president, Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia.After falling ill, he was taken to a treatment centre on the outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister.Under the supervision of health workers, family members escorted the doctor's body to a burial location west of the city, Nyenswah said.He said another doctor who had been working in Liberia's central Bong County was being treated for Ebola at the centre where Brisbane died.The situation "is getting more and more scary," Nyenswah said.Last week Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor fell ill with the disease and in Liberia, Samaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, announced at the weekend that an American doctor was infected. Dr Kent Brantly had been isolated at the group's Ebola treatment centre at the ELWA hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.A second American, Nancy Writebol, later tested positive for the virus at the same medical compound, said Ken Isaacs, of Samaritan's Purse. Isaacs said Writebol, who works with the allied aid group SIM, was in a stable but serious condition at a hospital near Monrovia.Brantly received intensive treatment on Sunday and was talking to his medical team and working on his computer, said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for Samaritan's Purse."We are hopeful, but he is certainly not out of the woods yet," Strickland said.In Nigeria, officials announced on Friday that a Liberian official had died of Ebola after flying from Monrovia to Lagos raising fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa. The WHO says the outbreak has also killed 319 people in Guinea and 224 in Sierra Leone.Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, used her Independence Day address to discuss a new taskforce to combat Ebola. Information minister, Lewis Brown, said: "It will go from community to community, from village to village, from town to town in order to increase awareness."There is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever and sore throat but then escalates to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding.Experts believe the west African outbreak could have begun in January in south-east Guinea, though the first cases were not confirmed until March.Since then, officials have tried to contain the disease by isolating victims and educating populations on how to avoid transmission, though porous borders, satellite outbreaks and widespread distrust of health workers have made the outbreak difficult to bring under control.http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/j ... s-outbreak

Kennedy Medical Center has become the latest casualty of the deadly Ebola virus.Dr. Brisbane, also a former Chief Medical Doctor at the Firestone Rubber Plantation Hospital had been quarantined along with a Physician Assistant and Doctor Nelson Korkor, the lead doctor at Phebe who was brought down to Monrovia three days ago after contracting the virus.Hospital sources say, Dr. Brisbane selected to treat himself at home initially in a bid not to spread the virus to others but was brought to the ELWA hospital where the Samaritan Group has been treating serious cases, when the illness worsened, until his death, Saturday.A hospital official told FrontPageAfrica Friday that Dr. Brisbane and the other ailing health workers were holding onto life, but that Dr. Brisbane vomited occasionally. The PA, however, is still said to be deteriorating, a senior hospital administrator told FrontPageAfrica on condition of anonymity. Dr. Brisbane's death comes just a day after the JFK's ER Wing was shut down and patients already in care moved to another floor in the hospital. Health care workers are bearing the brunt of the deadly outbreak.During programs marking the 167 Independence of Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf paid homage to the late Dr. Sam Mutooro Muhumuza, a Ugandan national, and all the health workers around the country who have made the ultimate sacrifice in saving lives. "To their families, loved ones, associates, we extend our heartfelt sympathy," she said, adding that the government will shortly reach out to the families of the departed health workers to bring them comfort in their times of trials and tribulations.http://allafrica.com/stories/201407281941.html

Patrick Nshamdze; (R) Plywood signs indicating those dumped in one mass grave in JohnsonvilleMon, 08/04/2014 - 11:30 admin Dumped with Others in Johnsonville Mass Grave By: Alaskai Moore Johnson, Observer Health Correspondent.The Daily Observer was told on Saturday, August 2, that the St. Joseph Catholic Hospital Chief Administrator, Bro/Dr. Patrick Nshamdze, has died, having contracted the deadly Ebola virus disease at least three weeks ago. He died Friday, August 1; he was 57.There were tears Saturday, August 2, at the Christ The King Catholic Church in Gaye Town when news filtered in that Bro Patrick has succumbed to the virus. He was very attached to the church and its members.Dr. Nshamdze, who preferred to be called “Bro. Patrick”, was from Cameroon and a member of the Catholic Community—Brothers of St. John of God. Bro. Patrick was one of the missionaries assigned at the St. Joseph Catholic Hospital in Congo Town. He was one of those very reliable medical practitioners, who kept the hospital intact and running.One Catholic source, who preferred to remain anonymous told the Observer that Bro Patrick had contracted the disease from a pregnant lady, who had been transferred from another health facility to the hospital. According to this source, the lady, who too, has died of the virus, came bleeding and it was Bro. Patrick, who had worked on her.“When Bro. Patrick was told that this lady had died from Ebola, he broke down, because he had had direct contact with her,” our source said.The Observer was told by other high-placed sources within the Catholic Church that the Church had requested his remains to be interred differently so that the Church and his relatives can one day pay homage to him but their plead was not granted as he was "dumped in a mass grave" containing at least 25 other victims, in Johnsonville, outside Monrovia.Very nearby the grave in which he and others were “dumped”, lay plywood billboards, indicating all of those buried in that mass grave.News filtered in late last night that Spain, which provides bulk of the hospital’s supports, was making plans to “evacuate” all the remaining missionary sisters and brothers assigned at the hospital.If this happens, it could be a deadly blow to the struggling health sector and nation at-large, grappling with the Ebola outbreak, which has claimed so many lives in Liberia. The St. Joseph Catholic Hospital is partially closed at the moment; this would be one last blow to finally close the hospital indefinitely.The Observer was told that the Catholic Church is expected to meet today to discuss these grave matters, including Bro. Patrick’s death.http://www.liberianobserver.com/news/eb ... hief-admin
