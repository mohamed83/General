Thirty states plus the District of Columbia have sought the Center for Disease Control's help identifying potential cases of Ebola.
The
map above is based on a list of those states provided to Breitbart News
Thursday by the CDC. The list shows (in bright red) all the states which
have asked for the CDC's help with potential Ebola cases since July
27th. 
When contacted for consultation, the CDC examines the
patient's symptoms and travel history to decide whether or not a
blood test is needed. In most cases, the CDC is able to rule out Ebola
without the need for a blood test.
 ABC News reported
Wednesday that the CDC was contacted 68 times since the end of last
month. In 58 of those cases Ebola was ruled out. In the ten remaining
cases CDC ordered a blood test. Seven of those tests have already returned
negative, and three are still outstanding.
The CDC did not have up-to-date information on the location of the 10 patients who have received Ebola tests thus far, but reports indicate
at least one patient was tested in New York, California, New Mexico,
Maryland, and Ohio. Patients in California and New Mexico are currently
awaiting test results.
Two patients who were transported to
America after contracting Ebola in West Africa were released from a
hospital in Atlanta this week. Both recovered after treatment which
included an experimental drug called ZMapp. The CDC pronounced both patients cured, issuing a statement saying, "They no longer have Ebola virus in their blood and therefore pose no risk to household contacts or the public."
