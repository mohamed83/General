August 21, 2014


















I have been doing some maths and research about the current ebola outbreak and found out the international flight connections that could very unlikely (the virus is NOT airborne) spread through air transport.My understanding is that only medical workers flying in or out from those countries are still allowed, but the media doesn't report clearly on this or the fact that continental Europe is better connected and closer to the areas where the virus has caused human loses.
