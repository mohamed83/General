Nisan Ahmed, health minister of the Kurdish authority in Kobani, established a medical team to examine the incident.  According to Ahmed, the bodies of three Kurdish fighters showed no signs of damage from bullets.  Rather  “burns and white spots on the bodies of the dead indicated the use of chemicals, which led to death without any visible wounds or external bleeding.” According to a UN report compiled after the departure of UN inspectors and quoted by Associated Press, bunker 41 contained “2,000 empty 155mm artillery shells contaminated with the chemical warfare agent mustard, 605 one-tonne mustard containers with residues, and heavily contaminated construction material.”

 Shelley Moore Capito is poised to win a Senate seat in West Virginia in a race few people are talking about. She's OK with that.





				    						    			Ken Feltman's insight:
				    						    	

 Shelley Moore Capito is an effective legislator who gets things done for her constituents. She is a leader who knows how to compromise. She also knows when to say "sorry, this is as far as I can go." Will she rise in the Senate leadership?

Police arrested dozens of protesters during the final of four days of rallies and civil disturbance to express anger at the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, by a white police officer in a St. Louis suburb. Organizers of the Ferguson October protests dubbed the day "Moral Monday" and committed acts of civil disobedience in and around St. Louis. More than 50 people were arrested.

 Ever year, the Republican Party grows more closely identified with the agenda of conservative Catholic bishops, and vice versa. Unfortunately, too many bishops have been tempted by the allure of political power as they join America’s culture wars. They treat Roe v. Wade as a litmus test and urge Catholics not to vote for Democrats, who are likely...
