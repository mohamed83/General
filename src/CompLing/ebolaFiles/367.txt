By  Ed Silverman 



Zuma Press


Top of the morning to you. And a fine one it is. Crystal clear blue skies and deliciously cool breezes are greeting us today, which calls for a celebration with – you guessed it – a cup of stimulation. Our flavor of choice this week is Golden French Toast, for those keeping track. Despite the gorgeous weather, there is much to keep us in front of the lap top, however. This sounds familiar, yes? So time to get started with a few tidbits. Have a wonderful day and drop us a line if you hear anything interesting…
U.S. healthcare spending is expected to grow more slowly in the coming decade as a sluggish economic recovery and higher cost sharing in private insurance plans limit demand for services, writes Reuters, citing a new government report. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid expects average annual healthcare spending to grow by 5.7 percent from 2013 to 2023, compared to 5.8 percent in last year’s projections, which covered the years 2012 to 2022. The projected growth rate is well below the 7.2 percent annual average between 1990 and 2008.
Google 's Calico and AbbVie  unveiled a potential $1.5 billion research partnership, marking the entrance of a potentially big player in developing treatments for age-related diseases, The Wall Street Journal reports. Each will invest up to $250 million, and potentially another $500 million each, to tackle conditions like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. But in keeping with its secretive posture,  Google has yet to say how many employees Calico has or whether it had begun any other research projects. Meanwhile, Calico ceo Art Levinson resigned from the Roche board to avoid any conflict.
An experimental vaccine against dengue fever being developed by Sanofi proved about 60 percent effective in its second large clinical trial, The New York Times says. The results could clear the way for the introduction of the world’s first inoculation against the disease, which is mosquito-borne and becoming an increasing threat.
New research published in Pediatrics found that children who took ADHD medicine didn’t have height deficits in adulthood, NPR tells us. Neither an ADHD diagnosis itself nor treatment with stimulant drugs was linked to a significant difference in growth or final height, compared to the average for that age and gender.
Johnson & Johnson plans to fast track development of a new combination vaccine regimen against Ebola amid a race to combat the worst outbreak of the deadly disease on record, Bloomberg News says. J&J will collaborate Bavarian Nordic and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
New York City is reporting a decrease in the number of oxycodone prescriptions, a reversal of a decade-long trend which has been blamed, in part, for a rash of overdose deaths, according to Capital New York.
The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has switched the status of the domperidone drug from over-the-counter to prescription only, on the back of fears over its potential cardiac side effects, Pharma Times writes.
In seeking to convince doctors the metal-on-metal version of the Pinnacle hip implants were safe, the Johnson & Johnson DePuy unit engaged in “marketing run amok,” a lawyer told jurors in the first case over the devices to go to trial, Bloomberg News reports.
In the first-ever public scrutiny of an M&A deal in India, the Competition Commission has invited comments from all stakeholders, including the public, on the details of the $4 billion deal in which Sun Pharma will buy Ranbaxy Labs, The Economic Times writes.
A former researcher at the Cetero clinical research organization says an FDA warning letter was contrived because of the way an inspection was conducted, according to InPharma Technologist.
