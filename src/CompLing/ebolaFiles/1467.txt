Opinion: How Nigeria has made too many errors on #Ebola

























Late Patrick Sawyer, The Liberian


Suddenly,
 four days after the visit of Patrick Sawyer to Lagos aboard a Liberian 
flight on the 20th of July and with the news of his demise at First 
Consultant Clinic, Obalende, Lagos, on the 24th, Nigerians began to 
shiver in disorientation and panic. The adrenaline in us rose; beginning
 from the first spot and permeating into the crannies, handshake and 
closeness became great omens.



The intrigues playing out since the unceremonious 
importation of the dreaded Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) by Patrick Sawyer 
into this country is, to say the least, disheartening.
 

The incoming of the Liberian financial expert had not only caused a 
further implosion in the already pulverized Nigerian health. It has put 
more stress on the disenchanted sector and has inflicted irretrievable 
injuries to the Nigerian citizens.

At the moment, three Nigerians have been confirmed dead from the 
fatal intrusion and ten more are infected. Many more are still 
undergoing surveillance for possible contraction. All these innocent and
 unsuspecting hard-working people were at their duty posts, when the 
stealth came.

It is a thing of grief to remember that prior to the flight that 
brought in the Liberian-American expatriate, the 
land of Nigeria and its
 citizens were not allies to this antagonist. We only heard of it on the
 air; as a matter of fact, it is assertive to say that a lot of the 
masses put arguably at 90% never knew the disease not even by 
nomenclature. The highly contagious viral infection transmitted by mere 
handshake had never formed part of our known existence; right from its 
first incidence in 1976 (in Zaire and Sudan).



With its re-emergence earlier this year, the people still had no 
reason to fear; nothing of such pensiveness existed in the minds of 
many. Aside the security issue posed by the Boko Haram insurgency and 
the system ineptitude from the suffocation of corruption in high places,
 the citizens not lived in such a fright as hysteric.

For no reasons were Nigerians afraid to shake their compatriots; a 
process, which of course has become ingrained as a modus vivendi. Not 
even the highly feared red buffer of HIV/AIDS could severe such 
cherished ‘institutionalized system’. We shook hands at will and 
passionately encircled ourselves in warmth embrace without fear and 
concern.

But, alas! the hitherto doodah, though in an unfortunate manner, have
 now worn a ‘celebrity’ status; widely known, not only by name but in 
our minds and souls. We can even make a hit song of it. It has indeed 
become comical as this; but the ills are always things of comic!

Suddenly, four days after the visit of Patrick Sawyer to Lagos aboard
 a Liberian flight on the 20th of July and with the news of his demise 
at First Consultant Clinic, Obalende, Lagos, on the 24th, Nigerians 
began to shiver in disorientation and panic. The adrenaline in us rose; 
beginning from the first spot and permeating into the crannies, 
handshake and closeness became great omens.

The font was opened for rumour-peddlers to feed widely on the sagged 
gullibility of unsuspecting citizens. Rumours became easily accepted for
 fact; a holey membrane wore on Nigerians who, for the safety of their 
lives, were never ready to waste any second in considerations to swallow
 the hook, line and sinker of falsehood.

And like the wild fire of the Harmattan, the fire burned with great 
volatility, setting ablaze many. The knowledge about the harmful health 
implications identified with the ingestion of large salt-dose flew to 
the winds; people out of jolt, gulped immeasurably the solution to sad 
discomfort and death!

Even as the masses realized quickly the ministry of ‘salt and water 
bath’ and sadly paid some price, it never ended there. The fright was 
never to leave, our adrenaline lingered than ever. And these are all 
post-Sawyer consequences; the results of his heinous importation.

However, what begs for explanations are the intricacies that 
surrounded his leaving Liberia and dying in Lagos. These questions which
 have won emphasis following the existing atmosphere beg emotionally and
 rationally for answers.

It was learnt that the viral importer had been handed over to the 
health personnel in Liberia for isolation after the news of his sister’s
 death from the virus dread by the company he worked for. He was 
subsequently kept under surveillance.

It was also gathered that, in an official capacity, the Finance 
Ministry of Liberia under which the ‘death-porter’ worked, probably 
unknown of his state, called on him to represent them at the ECOWAS 
conference in Calabar, Nigeria. Mr. Sawyer defied the quarantine 
restriction and embarked on that mission, which, unfortunately, was to 
be his last.  

From claimed CCTV footage, Mr. Patrick was nice enough to ‘avoid 
contact with unsuspecting individuals, even at greetings’. Nevertheless,
 one thing that beats the mind is how this ‘nice’ man could have 
neglected this same gentlemanly mien ab initio by informing his bosses 
of the state he was. Or did he but was compelled? This really comes up 
going by the later revelation of First Consultant Clinic that even at 
the treatment of their patient, the Liberian Finance Ministry officials 
kept pressuring them to release him for the conference.

Howbeit, even under such acclaimed compulsion, couldn’t Mr. Sawyer 
have been more nice and save his potential contacts the lots of stress 
in defying this ‘inane ministerial order’ instead? Should we assume a 
case of dual conspiracies?

Back to the internal milieu. The question that bogs is the measures, 
in proactive step, put in place since the news of the resurgence of the 
Ebola disease to prevent a possible implosion.

The outbreak of the supposed zoonotic ailment in Guinea, Sierra Leone
 and our close neighbour, Liberia has been a worldwide concern since 
March of this year. What has the entire Nigeria systems on disease 
control and prevention being doing ever since to safeguard the citizens?

Why must it be when the system has become drenched that the Nigerian 
institutions, herein to include the Federal Ministry of Health, Centre 
for Disease Control and the Airport authorities start calling for 
shelters?

The minister of health in one of his numerous post-drench briefings 
on the wake of the intrusion had indicated that mechanisms were on 
ground in our air terminals since the news of the outbreak to avert 
possible encroachment. It was actually, according to him, the process 
that led to the identification of the Sawyer case.

Good as it may be if what Prof Onyebuchi Chukwu said is anything to 
go by. But why did the action, proactive, have to stop at the airport? 
How did the Ebola Virus Disease slipped away from this commendable 
security measure to come in and comfortably sit down in our midst?

Patrick Sawyer, even as erroneous his act might have been, did not 
come into the country by astral means; he came through a physical route,
 the Lagos international airport. As such, the Nigerian authorities are 
not left out in some pertinent questions, of which include:

1. What effort did the personnel stationed thereto took to notify the
 health providers at First Consultant that he was an EVD suspect?

2. The airport men, did they not know that Mr Sawyer was coming from Liberia as to make such notification, preponderant?

3. Or did they not know that Liberia is an Ebola-having country as to designate anybody from there a suspect?

Some mistakes were better avoided. And this one stands prominently. 
The Liberian government and our internal health sector and its authority
 should be held culpable for exposing innocent and unsuspecting 
Nigerians to these unnecessary risks. However, as a Nigerian, I demand 
for accountability and responsibility from the Nigerian institutions.
