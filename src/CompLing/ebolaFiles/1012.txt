EBOLA VIRUS INFECTION




Ebola is a rare but deadly virus that causes bleeding inside and outside the body.

As the virus spreads through the body, it damages the immune system and organs. Ultimately, it causes levels of blood-clotting cells to drop. This leads to severe, uncontrollable bleeding.

The disease, also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever or Ebola virus, kills up to 90% of people who are infected.


Ebola can spread from country to country when people travel. So it is possible for it to reach any country if an infected person travels there. But there are ways to prevent people from coming to airports with the disease.

 VIEW THIS PHOTO VERY WELL

Airline crews are trained to spot the symptoms of Ebola in passengers flying from places where the virus is found. Crews are told to quarantine anyone who looks infected.


How Do You Get Ebola?

Ebola isnt as contagious as more common viruses like colds, influenza, or measles. It spreads to people by contact with the skin or bodily fluids of an infected animal, like a monkey, chimp, or fruit bat. Then it moves from person to person the same way. Those who care for a sick person or bury someone who has died from the disease often get it.

Other ways to get Ebola include touching contaminated needles or surfaces.

You cant get Ebola from air, water, or food. A person who has Ebola but has no symptoms cant spread the disease, either.
What Are the Symptoms of Ebola?

Early on, Ebola can feel like the flu or other illnesses. Symptoms show up 2 to 21 days after infection and usually include:

  High fever
    Headache
    Joint and muscle aches
    Sore throat
    Weakness
    Stomach pain
    Lack of appetite


As the disease gets worse, it causes bleeding inside the body, as well as from the eyes, ears, and nose.  Some people will vomit or cough up blood, have bloody diarrhea, and get a rash.

How Is Ebola Diagnosed?

Sometimes it's hard to tell if a person has Ebola from the symptoms alone. Doctors may test to rule out other diseases like cholera or malaria.

Tests of blood and tissues also can diagnose Ebola.

HOW TO LEAVE A HYGEINIC LIFE AND KEEP AWAY FROM EBOLA:

1.  ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS

2.  KEEP AWAY FROM FRUIT BATS AND OTHER BUSH ANIMALS.. STAY AWAY FROM BUSHMEAT FOR NOW

3. 
    AVOID UNNECESSARY HAND SHAKES FOR NOW

4.  USE THE RIGHT SANITIZER

5. ENLIGHTEN EVERY ONE AROUND YOU.. FAMILY AND FRIENDS... SHARE THIS PAGE WITH THEM 

Copy this link in the brackets and share with every one you know  ( http://www.nairawall.com/lagos/lagos-mainland/news/viewpoint/497 )

If you have Ebola, youll be isolated from the public immediately to prevent the spread.
