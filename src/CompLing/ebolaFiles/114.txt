MAPUTO, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has stepped up efforts to prevent the entry of the dreaded Ebola virus which has claimed over 1,000 lives in West African countries since earlier this year, the country's health authorities said Thursday.
The Mozambican health authorities said that as from now on, all borders are on alert and people from the affected countries or who flew via Kenya to enter Mozambique will be subject to questioning.
Kenyan Airways flys to Mozambique at least twice a week, and Kenya has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a "high-risk" country for the spread of the deadly Ebola virus.
According to the WHO, Kenya was vulnerable because it was a major transport hub, with many flights from West Africa.
Kenya receives more than 70 flights a week from West Africa.
The Kenyan government said it would not ban flights from the four Ebola-hit countries -- Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
According to the ministry of health, the measure will be applied to all frontiers -- land and maritime as well. Land and maritime passengers will be checked.
Mozambique is not banning flights to the country, but it says strict control will exerted to every passenger who is suspected to have symptoms of fever, intensive debilities, muscle pains, headache and throat pains.
The ministry has set up an isolation unit at Mavalane Geral Hospital, in the Maputo city surroundings for a possible outbreak of the epidemic.
"The idea is to allow people suspected of catching Ebola in various health units to be sent to the isolation unit in order to be treated, and avoid contamination", said Joao Tembe, head of the project within the ministry of health.
Before being sent to the isolation unit, said Tembe, the patient will be taken to pre-isolation room in the first aid within the hospital to be checked properly.
The isolation units has 10 beds, 5 for women and the other 5 for men, in different rooms.
Tembe also revealed that by the end of the week, the Mavalane isolation unit will be totally equipped.
This center used to accommodate people suffering from cholera.
Mozambique has never been hit by the disease, but Tembe says that with Kenya at risk of being hit by the illness, Mozambique must be on alert, because the country receives visitors from West Africa, who pass through the East African nation.
