What's scary about Ebola, reasons not to fear it














PROVIDENCE — From a continent away, the Ebola scourge brought crushing news to two ministers at the Generations for Christ Mission Church.The Rev. Ezekial Kparkar Solee learned that his 25-year-old brother had died in Liberia last Friday after a three-day illness. The symptoms pointed to the Ebola virus.“His body has been in the house since Friday. Only the government can touch or bury Dennis’ body, not family,” a text from a relative said. “It is being suspected that he died of Ebola.”
Mr. Solee received confirmation Sunday: “They are sure he died from Ebola.”The Rev. Sahr J. Kallon, also interviewed at the church, said his cousin, a physician, died of Ebola in Sierra Leone last week. “He worked as a medical doctor for 34 years for the government. That is how it is suspected” that he contracted the virus, Kallon said.On Sunday, the Rev. Mother Naomi Smith asked the congregation “to pray for Africa” and to comfort Solee and Kallon. “We have to keep praying.”They prayed, and sang, for hours.“I can say we should not only seek the interest of Liberia, but the virus is spreading through Africa,” Ms. Smith said. “We need help for Africa. We need food, we need international help, we need medical supplies.”The disease has claimed nearly 1,000 lives in four West African countries — Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, with close to 1,800 confirmed cases. It is the largest Ebola outbreak ever. Mr. Solee last saw his brother Dennis in 2001, “when he was still a boy.”That year, Mr. Solee came to Providence as a refugee from his war-torn homeland. While his family remained behind, he melded into the largest Liberian community per capita in this country.Mr. Solee said his brother “had some pharmacy training,” and traveled outside Monrovia — the capital — selling medications and delivering first aid.“For people who are not able to go far distances, they walk to them,” he explained.After his brother died, “there was an examination” by medical personnel. “The medical personnel on the scene said he died from Ebola.”After that, “nobody entered the house. They told them not to enter.… When they find out it is not Ebola, they can tell you to go bury them. This one, they said don’t go near.”But on Sunday, his brother’s body was wrapped and buried, he said.“It’s terrible,” Mr. Solee said. “I am very downhearted.”Meanwhile, he said, “Hunger is killing the people over there. It’s not only Ebola, but any illness that you have. When you go to the hospital or clinic, they will not accept you … sometimes even to go buy food, you are scared to go. The people in the store, they’re scared to receive you. So it becomes very difficult.” During a separate interview at the church, Mr. Kallon said his cousin who died was 68.Mr. Kallon noted that the congregation of the Generations for Christ Mission Church includes people from several West African countries; all are concerned about family and friends there.“I have over 200 relatives” in Sierra Leone, Kallon said. The Rhode Island Council of Churches will hold a prayer service at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Providence’s West End.The Rev. Donald Anderson, president of the council, said the prayers are for all the West African countries affected by the Ebola outbreak.
