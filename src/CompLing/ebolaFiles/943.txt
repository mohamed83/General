All quiet on the ebola front in Lincolnshire


Picture the scene around the newsdesk of the Lincolnshire Echo:
"We need a local angle on the ebola story."
"But there really isn't one."
"Well just write that then..."

(hat tip @Calum_Fuller)

The first line of the story confirms the absence of news:
"No-one in Lincolnshire has so far had to be tested for Ebola, officials have revealed. Bosses at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust say they have so far not been informed of any tests taking place in the county."
