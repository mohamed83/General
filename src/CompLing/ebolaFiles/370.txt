          Finra Warns of Ebola Stock Scams

EbolaFinra 


















By  Maureen Farrell

Fears over the spread of the Ebola virus have been gripping the world. Even the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has weighed in with a warning.
In a new investor alert, Finra is cautioning investors to be wary of buying stocks in companies that claim to be developing products designed to halt the spread of viruses or other harmful diseases.
The organization said it is aware of several potential scams involving such stock promotions. It didn’t name them, but said they were using typical “pump-and-dump” tactics by issuing optimistic statements through press releases, emails and other promotions intended to create demand for the companies’ stock shares.
Later, the group said, the con artists will sell off their shares at a profit, leaving investors with worthless shares.
“News coverage of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is likely to catch the interest of ‘pump and dump’ scammers looking to capitalize on fears of a potential pandemic,” said Gerri Walsh, Finra’s senior vice president for investor education, in a statement.
Finra, a Wall-Street-funded self-regulatory group, urged investors who hear about such companies to be skeptical of promotional materials from unknown senders that hype a company and its products. “Dozens of press releases issued over a short period of time and containing essentially the same news can be a serious red flag,” they wrote in the investor alert released Thursday.
The alert urged investors to read a company’s securities filings, be wary of frequent changes to a company’s name or business focus and not to fall for name dropping. “Citing a relationship with a government agency, prominent company or academic institution may be a ploy to create legitimacy for a company that does not deserve it,” Finra said.
It also cautioned that most pump-and-dump schemes involve stocks that trade over the counter instead of on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange.
