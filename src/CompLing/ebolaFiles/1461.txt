			Nigerian Ebola education website traffic ‘soars’					



	Published on 07 August 2014	

By Gareth van Zyl



Educational website EbolaFacts.com, which took 24 hours to build, has notched up over half a million hits in just one week according to its makers.
A deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has to date claimed almost 1,000 lives, prompted Lagos-based publishing house Big Cabal Media to curate and launch the website.
The website warns of Ebola symptoms, explains what the virus is, dispels myths surrounding it and communicates the means of the virus' transmission to a West African audience.
And Big Cabal Media claims that since launch, “the site has received over 600,000 hits and has been seen on Facebook about 850,000 times.”

Big Cabal Media’s Dr. Seyi Taylor told ITWeb Africa that his organisation uses Google Analytics to determine the site’s traffic levels.
“There have also been requests for it to be printed for wider distribution to communities without the internet,” says Big Cabal Media in a press statement.
“Content from the site has also been developed into a flyer, newspaper ads and digital billboards. Work is now ongoing to translate the site to French, Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa and Pidgin to cater to a growing regional audience,” adds the statement.
