Merriam Webster defines "overwhelm" as: to affect (someone)
very strongly; to cause (someone) to have too many things to deal
with; to defeat (someone or something) completely. Overwhelm also means: upset, overthrow; to cover over completely,
submerge; to overcome by superior force or numbers; to overpower in
thought or feeling----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------, "My heart is severely pained within me, and the terrors of
death have fallen upon me. Fearfulness and trembling have come upon
me, and horror has overwhelmed me. So I said, 'Oh, that I had wings
like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. Indeed, I would wander
far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah I would hasten my escape
from the windy storm and tempest'" (Ps 55:4-8). "From the end of the earth I will cry to You, when my heart is
overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I" (Psalm
61:2).  "When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then You knew my
path" (Psalm 142:3). "The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him,
and I am helped;Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song
I will praise Him" (Ps28:7)."God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear, even though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; Though its
waters roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with its
swelling" (Psalm 46:1-3)."Be still, and know that I am God" (Psalm 46:10)."I cry aloud with my voice to the Lord. I make supplication with
my voice to the Lord. I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare my
trouble before Him.When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, You knew
my path. In the way where I walk they have hidden a trap for me. Look
to the right and see; for there is no one who regards me; There is no
escape for me; no one cares for my soul.      "I cried out to You, O Lord; I said, 'You are my refuge, my
portion in the land of the living. Give heed to my cry, for I am
brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too
strong for me. Bring my soul out of prison, so that I may give thanks
to Your name; The righteous will surround me, for You will deal
bountifully with me'" (Psalm 142). Amen!"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let
patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking nothing. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who
gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to
him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is
like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that
man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a
double-minded man, unstable in all his ways" (James 1:2-8). "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"
(Phil 4:13).

Many of our faith are feeling overwhelmed these days, but the Lord is the end of our journey as He is the beginning of it. Nothing can separate us from Him. Nothing except US. I choose to become "underwhelmed" by the world and completely submerged in Jesus Christ! It's hard to keep our eyes where they belong sometimes, but I believe when we really come into His presence, we won't be able to look anywhere else!
