The official death toll from the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa is currently standing at 1,145 deaths out of 2,127 cases, but the numbers could be vastly underestimated, the World Health Organization has warned.

“[WHO] staff at the outbreak sites see evidence that the
  numbers of reported cases and deaths vastly underestimate
  the magnitude of the outbreak,” the
  organization wrote on its website.

  While no new cases surfaced, the outbreak is expected to continue
  “for some time” in West African states affected by the
  virus, the WHO said, adding that the “operational response plan
  extends over the next several months.”

  WHO is coordinating the international response such as the World
  Food Programme and is using its “well-developed logistics to
  deliver food to the more than one million people locked down in
  the quarantine zones, where the borders of Guinea, Liberia, and
  Sierra Leone intersect.” The organization is also mapping
  out the outbreak to effectively locate closest treatment
  facilities.


  Meanwhile Guinea has declared a “health emergency” as the number of people
  killed by the Ebola virus reached 380 in the country.

  As the number of deaths rises, the affected countries eagerly
  await experimental drugs from Western pharmaceutical firms that
  have been blessed by the WHO as ethical to treat the ill.

  ethics of testing drugs on humans

  In the worst epidemic since the disease was first discovered in
  1976, the death toll has now reached 1,069 with 56 people dying
  in the last two days and a total of around 2,000 infected.
