New Ebola Cases Unrelated To West African Outbreak

If there can be any good news – or at least not further disheartening news – coming out of the African continent regarding this year’s Ebola outbreaks, we have one positive report this morning.
The World Health Organization has just confirmed that the newly-identified cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo is genetically unrelated to the strain currently circulating in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.
A WHO collaborating research center in Franceville, Gabon, the Centre International de Recherches Médicales, had previously identified six Ebola positive samples sent to the laboratory. They report today that, “the virus in the Boende district is definitely not derived from the virus strain currently circulating in west Africa.”
The WHO amplified that finding: 

“Results from the virus characterization, together with findings from the epidemiological investigation, are definitive: the outbreak in DRC is a distinct and independent event, with no relationship to the outbreak in west Africa.”

The finding is worthy of such emphasis because of concerns that the west African outbreak had somehow spread to the DRC, formerly Zaire. The viruses in each outbreak are genetically distinct, but they are both of the Zaire species of Ebola virus, a fact that might be confused as meaning the outbreaks are related.

The form of the Zaire virus currently circulating in the DRC is most closely related to one responsible for an outbreak in 1995 in the city of Kikwit. Ebola virus first emerged in the DRC and South Sudan in 1976. The current outbreak in the DRC is the seventh on record.
The index case has been clearly identified as a pregnant woman from Ikanamongo Village who died on August 11 after preparing bushmeat that her husband had hunted.
The means of viral spread, as reported by the WHO, is typical of most Ebola outbreaks: “Local customs and rituals associated with death meant that several health-care workers were exposed and presented with similar symptoms in the following week.”
Thus far, the WHO has identified 53 cases consistent with a diagnosis of Ebola, including 31 deaths. Seven of the dead were healthcare workers.
But the WHO stressed that the outbreak is primarily occurring in a remote region of the DRC, about 750 miles from the capital of Kinshasa.

I use “good” in a relative sense. The situation would be far worse if the DRC outbreak were related to the west African cases in that it would suggest the disease had become even more widespread and transmissible, likely involving even more countries. The DRC cases are in a remote area, not in any if the large cities. So, the impact, while terrible anywhere, should be relatively limited. I’m reaching for all the positive news I can.

Given the current world unrest, it is not beyond the pale that the African contagion is an act of biological terrorism.

Are not both strains originated from human interaction with hunting/cooking/eating bush meat/monkey meat?
If so, can not one say the two strains are related in that respect and further that neither can be eliminated until bush meat related lifestyle is altered/eliminated and hence share a solution?

Related, yes, but distinctly different in terms of the index introduction of each outbreak.

I understand what you’re getting at. It just seems so frightening that a second outbreak is occuring while the original is still raging. Very interesting article.

I will try not to sully your desire to find a positive spin on this DRC outbreak, but I have to point out that the 1995 Kikwit outbreak had a higher mortality rate (around 83%)than we are seeing in the West African outbreak. If the strain for the new DRC outbreak is related to the 1995 one the current outbreak could be just as lethal as the 1995 one. Right now 31/53 dead is about 60% mortality, but this is just the start of the new DRC outbreak. Given the typical from previous outbreaks the mortality rate will continue to rise before the outbreak is over. Let’s just hope that given the heightened alert about Ebola in general health workers will be able to prevent the DRC outbreak from becoming too extensive.

Wow! That was a close call! Thankfully it was unrelated. So how many human infecting strains do we have now?

….Sierra Leone has a Hospital that treats tuberculosis and leprosy (unknown words in the US)? Now they have Ebola spreading ……. and the Obama administration has a Welcome Sign posted on our southern border !
People and Governments that are loose and reckless with hygiene and sanitation have been the causes of the greatest outbreaks of disease and infection throughout history.
All it takes is one infected person to start an epidemic and our Government is hiding many facts about the massive influx of ILLEGAL immigrants flooding the southern border!
“We the People” demand to know what the H E L L is going on with all these ILLEGALS being dispersed throughout our country!!

The “ILLEGAL immigrants flooding the southern border!” is a completely unnecessary non sequitur. If you care to comment, please be constructive and on point.

Could it be that the freaks of crime have been busy creating bugs that are more successful at killing humans. Not sure but I leraned some interesting ideas in this book Lab 257.
http://ebooktop.biz/pdf/title/lab-257-.html
Has the government ever played with us as test bunnies? Yes. There is the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment.
How can I not believe if they did it once they won’t do it again?
” 1. In 1966, the U.S. Army dispensed Bacillus subtilis variant niger throughout the New York City subway system. 1977 Senate hearings on Health and Scientific Research confirmed that 239 populated areas had been contaminated with biological agents between 1949 and 1969, including San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Key West, Panama City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis.
2. From the 1950′s onwards, the U.S. government deliberately engaged in open air tests, spraying major cities like San Francisco and New York with Serratia marcescens and Bacillus glogigii. In 1955, the CIA also released a a bacteria withdrawn from the Army’s biological warfare arsenal over Tampa Bay, Fl in order to test its ability to infect human populations with biological agents. 3. In August 1994, residents in the Oakville, Washington area reported tiny blobs of gelatinous goo raining from the sky, and in 1997 residents in the Everett area of Washington State reported similar a phenomenon.”
Then this -
“ A ttorney John Loftus was hired in 1979 by the Ofﬁce of Special Inves- tigations, a unit set up by the Justice Department to expose Nazi war crimes and unearth Nazis hiding in the United States. Given top-secret clearance to review ﬁles that had been sealed for thirty-ﬁve years, Loftus found a treasure trove of information on America’s postwar Nazi recruit- ing. In 1982, publicly challenging the government’s complacency with the wrongdoing, he told 60 Minutes that top Nazi ofﬁcers had been protected and harbored in America by the CIA and the State Department. “They got the Emmy Award,” Loftus wrote. “My family got the death threats.”
Erich Traub had been working for the American biological warfare program from his 1949 Soviet escape until 1953. We know he consulted with Fort Detrick scientists and CIA operatives; that he worked for the USDA for a brief stint; and that he spoke regularly with Plum Island direc- tor Doc Shahan in 1952. Traub can be physically placed on Plum Island at least three times—on dedication day in 1956 and two visits, once in 1957 and again in the spring of 1958. Shahan, who enforced an ultrastrict policy against outside visitors, each time received special clearance from the State Department to allow Traub on Plum Island soil.
Even more disturbing are the records of the Nazi germ warfare scien- tists who came to America. They experimented with poison ticks dropped from planes to spread rare diseases. ”
Guess what location Plum Island is close to? Can you say Lyme Connecticut?
Did the freaks on Plum Island take a disease that existed throughout history and make it strong enough to be a germ warfare agent that is spread by ticks?
The more I read and the more I know the less I trust the governments of the world.

Hey, hey, hey! I don’t think we need to go tossing around the N word here Robert. Try….” In 1966, the U.S. Army dispensed Bacillus subtilis variant ‘African American’ throughout the New York City subway system.” instead. Or “In 1966, the U.S. Army dispensed Bacillus subtilis variant ‘of color’ throughout the New York City subway system.”

Sorry it is a word I personally don’t use but that is what they (government) called it. Need talk to the government about their language.

The word “Niger?” You can’t be serious. You are confusing this spelling with the derogatory version with two G’s. The descriptions he quoted are the Latin name for the virus and its variants. Hopefully we haven’t slipped so far as to start attacking Latin as racist, too. But, these days, anything can happen.
See below, so there’s no (further) confusion. ——- From www.epa.gov/oppt/biotech/pubs/fra/fra009.htm
Former species designations that are now considered to be members of the species B. subtilis include B. aterrimus, B. mesentericus, B. niger, B. panis, B. vulgarus, B. nigrificans, and B. natto (Gibson, 1944 and Smith et al., 1946 as cited by Gordon, 1973).

Call me crazy but I have difficulty getting excited about a disease that can only be caught through physical contact with one who is infected and cannot survive out of the host body, or bodily fluids or waste, or in any environment other than the tropics. While this might present a problem for those sharing a bottle or joint or needle, mightn’t the gene pool survive, or even improve slightly from, the loss of their particular genes?
