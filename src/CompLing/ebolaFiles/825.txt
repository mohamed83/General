In the past few weeks there has been a spread of a terrifying Ebola virus. Few years back there was another endemic spread of H1N1 virus. 
According the medical scientists there are about 10^31 (10 in the power of 31) viruses which is 10 million times more than the number of stars in the galaxy. They say there are 100 times as many virus as there are human cells in the body. Imagine the diversity of viruses out there.
Are all of them dangerous to humans? Scientists have made a list of the most dangerous virus in the World based on the fatality rate. If you thought of HIV than let me tell you that it isn't even included in the top ten list.
The most dangerous viruses known up to date:
1. Marburg virus2. Ebola virus - Zaire Ebola virus being the deadliest3. Hantavirus 4. Bird flu virus5. Lassa virus6. Junin virus7. Crimea-Congo fever virus8. Machupo virus9. Kyasanur Forest Virus (KFD)10. Dengue virus
The list goes on and on. Whatever the name be, it is a virus and it's here to cause disease which most likely will end up with fatality. Some can make it and some won't.
