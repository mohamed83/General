Sign UpWAYLAND (CBS/AP) –  The Nebraska doctors treating the man who became infected with Ebola while working in Liberia say he is making progress, but it’s not yet clear if he will recover.
Dr. Rick Sacra, who works at the Family Health Center in Worcester and lives in Holden, arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center on Friday for treatment in the hospital’s specialized 10-bed isolation unit. Two of the doctors treating him gave an update on his condition Sunday.
Dr. Phil Smith says Sacra, 51, who grew up in Wayland, remains very tired, but his progress has been encouraging.
Sacra has been helping with his own treatment by providing information about Ebola to the doctors because he saw it in Africa.
Smith says Sacra has even made a few jokes with the doctors treating him.
Dr. Paul Church, a urologist who knows Sacra and has performed mission work in the same area of Liberia, said, “it’s a very touch and go situation, I think. They are pleased there are some signs of improvement.”

Sacra has had a video call with his wife from the hospital, Church said.
Church, who spoke outside the Trinitarian Congregational Church in Wayland after an event to support Sacra, said he had recently spoken to Sacra.
“He didn’t really express any fears about returning. He was confident that he needed to go back to help the people of Liberia that he has been so connected with for years. His motivation in doing this is above and beyond of just helping the people,” Church said. “He knew there was a great need there.”
The 51-year-old Sacra is the third American aid worker to be sickened with the Ebola virus.
