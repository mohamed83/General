        COMMENTEMAILMORE(USA TODAY) -- President Obama on Tuesday will announce an expansion of a $763 million U.S. plan to help West Africa nations fight the spread of the Ebola virus, officials said Monday night.Adding to an existing project, the project calls for more doctors and health care providers; more portable hospitals laboratories, and medical supplies; and increased training for first responders and other medical officials.The total cost of the program is estimated at $763 million, officials said, including $175 million that has already been dedicated.RELATED |  President Obama to visit CDC next week for Ebola briefing 11Alive.com will have live coverage of the President's visit to Atlanta beginning at 2 p.m.LINK | CDC to hospitals: 'Now is the time to prepare' for EbolaThe administration has asked Congress for an additional $88 million for the anti-Ebola program, officials said. And the Department of Defense, which is heading up the program, has requested the re-programming of $500 million.Obama plans to discuss the program during a visit Tuesday to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Senior administration officials described the program on the condition they not be named so as not to preempt the president's announcement.During his visit to the CDC, Obama "will receive a briefing on the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, discuss the U.S. response and thank the scientists, doctors and health care workers helping those affected by disease at home and around the world," said the White House schedule.The Department of Defense will work with the United States Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control.About 3,000 U.S. military personnel will be in West Africa to lead the project, officials said.The virus does not threaten the United States, and will not if the right steps are taking, officials.While declining to discuss the plan in detail, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama believes that "making an investment here early is critical to trying to snuff out this problem before it becomes a much more widespread problem."EBOLA COVERAGE | .- Ebola: #FactsNotFear- Dallas hospital confirms first Ebola case diagnosed in U.S- Dallas Ebola patient dies- Dallas nurse tests positive for Ebola- Nina Pham: 'I'm doing well and want to thank everyone'- Second health care worker in Dallas has Ebola; headed to AtlantaMORE COVERAGE OF EBOLA OUTBREAK AND TREATING PATIENTS IN ATLANTA- GALLERY: Dr. Kent Brantly arrives for treatment at Emory- GALLERY: Nancy Writebol arrives for treatment at Emory- GALLERY: Dr. Kent Brantly leaves hospital- NBC EXCLUSIVE: Dr. Kent Brantly talks to Today's Matt Lauer about recovery from Ebola- Another U.S. Doctor Catches Ebola virus in West Africa.- VIDEO: Dr. Kent Brantly thanks God and doctors, "thankful for being alive"- What cured Ebola patients Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol?- Emory Ebola patients now immune, but face long recovery- American Ebola victim looks forward to family reunion- David Writebol not sure how wife contracted Ebola- Son of American Ebola patient: Mom's 'smiling, even joking'- Missionaries return to U.S., enter Ebola quarantine- Husband of US Ebola patient surprised by critics- Dr. Brantly makes statement while recovering- Threats made prior to Ebola patient's arrival in Atlanta- An inside look at a life saving plane- Questions remain about serum used to treat Ebola patient- 2nd Ebola patient carried into Emory on stretcher- 1st Ebola patient walks into Emory for treatment- Liberians living in Georgia speak about Ebola outbreak- No surprises yet in treatment of Ebola patients at Emory- CDC shifts Ebola attention to travellers- Clips give insight into America Ebola patients- Questions answered about Ebola patients in Atlanta
