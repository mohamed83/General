Both men who brought Ebola to Nigeria have links to Soros funded Ecowas

The two men who have been instrumental in bringing Ebola to Nigeria had close ties with Ecowas.
Ecowas is funded by a George Soros foundation. Another George Soros foundation OISWA is calling for a special Ecowas envoy to be appointed to take charge of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
Ecowas paid for the ticket of the sick airline passenger, Patrick Sawyer, who spread Ebola virus to Nigeria when he flew from Liberia to Lagos on Jul 20.

One of Sawyer’s close contacts in Lagos, Ibukun Koye  the Head of the ECOWAS Liaison Office in Lagos, escaped from quarantine on the day Swayer died, and went to Port Harcourt, Nigeria”s oil hub,  where he infected a doctor whom he deceived. The doctor and his wife have died but others have been infected.
The Ecowas official recovered – if he was ever sick – but could face manslaughter charges.

It may be a coincidence that these two men were aided and abetted by Ecowas in their singular efforts to spread Ebola to one of the world’s most popular cities, Lagos, and beyond. But it might be a sign that Ecowas , with all the advantages of a diplomatic organization when it comes to travel, is a front for bioterrorism using humans as weapons. Given George Soros’ involvement in Ecowas, my tip is the later.
