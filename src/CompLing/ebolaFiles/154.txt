Four new cases of Ebola were reported in Nigeria on Aug. 8, and all of the cases were in people who had contact with the Liberian-American man who died from Ebola last month, The Washington Post first reported. Gregory Hartl, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, told The Washington Post that “they’re all contacts of Patrick Sawyer,” and that they include cleaners and hospital and health care workers. Sawyer collapsed after getting off a plane in Nigeria, having traveled from Liberia. A nurse who treated him has also contracted the virus and died. The WHO reports that there are now 13 probable or suspected cases of Ebola in Nigeria. The news comes as Nigeria’s president declared a national state of emergency over the outbreak. Nigeria’s president also approved emergency funds equivalent to $11.7 million to “strengthen steps to contain the virus such as … additional isolation centers, case management, contact tracing, deployment of additional personnel, screening at borders, and the procurement of required items and facilities,” a spokesman for the president told Reuters. The World Health Organization also declared the current West Africa Ebola outbreak to be an international public health emergency; Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia have reported cases and deaths of the deadly virus. Nearly 1,000 people have died from the outbreak since it started earlier this year. Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that a doctor and nurse who treated Sawyer had died from Ebola. Only a nurse who cared for Sawyer has died from the virus.

One preacher advocated fasting and prayer to spare people from a virus that usually leads to a horrible death. Some people pray that the Ebola virus stays confined to a rural district. Others are unruffled and say the outbreak will blow over. (Kjell Gunnar Beraas/MSF/AP)

The owners of a "maquis," a small African restaurant in Kobakro, outside Abidjan, which used to serve bush meat, hold up the different types of meat and fish they now offer to their clients. The Ministry of Health has asked Ivorians, "particularly fond of porcupine and agouti," a small rodent, to avoid consuming or handling bushmeat, as an unprecedented Ebola epidemic hit West Africa. The virus can spread to animal primates and humans who handle infected meat -- a risk given the informal trade in "bushmeat" in forested central and west Africa. (Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images)

Nigeria was on alert against the possible spread of Ebola on July 26, a day after the first confirmed death from the virus in Lagos, the country's financial capital and Africa's biggest city. The health ministry said Friday that a 40-year-old Liberian man died at a private hospital in Lagos from the disease, which has now killed more than 650 people in four west African countries since January.

The announcement late Sunday came a day after Sirleaf formed a new taskforce charged with containing the disease, which has killed 129 people in the country and more than 670 across the region.
