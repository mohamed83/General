      Five things you need to know about the IRC's Ebola response [VIDEO]

Donate to our Ebola crisis response and help save lives. Give Now.The scale and severity of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is unprecedented. The International Rescue Committee has been on the front lines of this health crisis since the start, providing lifesaving assistance in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In this video, IRC epidemiologist Ruwan Ratnayake talks about the five things you need to know about our emergency response.VIDEO TRANSCRIPTIONTitle: Five things you need to know about the IRC's Ebola response with IRC epidemiologist Ruwan RatnayakeRuwan: This Ebola outbreak is the largest and most complex outbreak of Ebola to date. It originated in Guinea and high areas of transmission have included Sierra Leone and Liberia with lower levels established in Nigeria and Senegal.Ruwan: More than 4,000 cases have been identified and 50 percent of those cases have died. It's unprecedented in terms of Ebola outbreaks.Ruwan: Because the IRC has been involved in Sierra Leone and Liberia since the nineties, they're in a good position to work on this outbreak.Title: 1. Public Health SupportRuwan: Given the scale of the outbreak and the activities needed to address prevention and control of the disease, it's very important that partners work in unison to respond.Ruwan: So we're working very closely with the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the governments of Sierra Leone and Liberia and other nongovernmental partners to really pull off this response.Title: 2. Community SensitizationRuwan: Given that the outbreak has lasted many months already, large part of the problem is that communities are still fearful and mistrustful of the response to date. IRC-trained health volunteers, through their long term community ties, are addressing some of the fear that exits in these communities and spreading prevention messages.Title: 3. Surveillance and contact tracingRuwan: Once an Ebola patient is identified, it's vital to track the significant contacts they've made in the community and then monitor those contacts over time to see if they developed the disease. Once we find out they did develop the disease, it's important to refer them to treatment which also prevents further transmission in that community.Ruwan: The IRC is supporting the infrastructure to make this surveillance work. They're providing vehicles, fuel and so forth.Title: 4. Protective EquipmentRuwan: So health workers who normally deliver primary health care in health facilities across these countries are now having to deal with suspected cases of Ebola. These health workers must be reinforced with the proper supplies to protect them and to protect other patients. Ruwan: The IRC is supplying medical equipment, infection control materials and reinforcing infection control practice in the health facilities. Title: 5. Scaling UpRuwan: The World Health Organization anticipates that the outbreak will last 6-9 months and could affect as many as 20,000 people.Ruwan: As the outbreak grows, the IRC will grow its response accordingly to reach more people and save lives.
