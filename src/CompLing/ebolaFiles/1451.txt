Ebola has become a major challenge to public health and is now a critical concern to our nation, West Africa and indeed the world.“We are all aware of the informed professional medical advice on the need to avoid body contacts, which is basically the easiest and common form of transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease. We are using this platform to plead with you and all concerned, to call off the planned campaign rally in the interest of adhering to the advice of ‘avoiding body contacts’, which you know is inevitable if the rally is allowed to hold.”  Copyright 2014 TheCable.
