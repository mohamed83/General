Why Are So Many Women Dying From Ebola?
Studies show that
infectious disease often affects one gender more than another -- but that knowledge isn't being put into practice. 



			BY Lauren Wolfe					

Lauren Wolfe is a journalist and director of Women Under Siege, a journalism project on sexualized violence based at the Women's Media Center in New York.

Public HealthgenderAfrica 



When people started dying from Ebola in West Africa in
March, Martha Anker, a former statistician in communicable disease surveillance and response at the World
Health Organization (WHO), began watching the news to see whom primarily the
terrible disease would strike. Sitting in her house in Massachusetts, Anker had
a gut feeling: that Ebola, as it had in the past, would claim women as its
primary victims. 


As it turns out, Anker was right.


On Aug. 14, the Washington Post reported that
across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone collectively, women have comprised 55
to 60 percent of the dead. In Liberia, the government has reported that 75
percent of victims are women. "I felt very sad when I read that thing
from the Washington Post," Anker
says. "I'm so sorry to be right."


Back
in 2007, Anker wrote in a WHO report, "Differences in exposure between
males and females have been shown to be important factors in transmission of
EHF [Ebola hemorrhagic fever]. Therefore, it is important to understand the
gender roles and responsibilities that affect exposure in the local area."


That entreaty clearly didn't find its way to West Africa
when this current outbreak began. Ebola spreads through contact with blood and other
bodily fluids, and in Liberia, as in neighboring countries,
women are usually the primary caregivers for the sick. They continue to
be during the current epidemic -- they stay in their homes and become infected
by their children or husbands instead of seeking out doctors and nurses for
their loved ones. Rarely are the roles reversed. "If
a man is sick, the woman can easily bathe him but the man cannot do so," says Marpue Spear, the
executive director of the Women's NGO Secretariat of Liberia (WONGOSOL). "Traditionally, women will take care of
the men as compared to them taking care of the women."


It shouldn't take so many deaths -- more
than 1,200 at the time of this writing -- to realize how attention to
gender dynamics might help save lives (in this case through, among other
things, targeted messaging to women about the importance of using protective
measures at home or allowing loved ones to be cared for by trained
professionals). Indeed, there shouldn't have to be Cassandras like Anker -- for Ebola and other diseases. 


Data show that many infectious diseases affect one
gender more than another. Sometimes it's men, as
with dengue fever. Sometimes it's women generally, as with E.
coli, HIV/AIDS
(more than half the people living with the virus are female), and Ebola in some previous outbreaks.
Sometimes it's pregnant women and mothers, as
with H1N1 (an outbreak
in Australia is currently infecting women over men by a 25 percent margin). 


Yet when women are the primary victims of an epidemic, few
are willing to recognize that this is the case, ask why, and build responses accordingly.
Indeed, experts say that too little is being done to put even the small amount
that is known about gender differences and infectious diseases into practice --
to determine in advance of outbreaks, for instance, how understanding gender
roles might help in the development of a containment or prevention strategy. Not
only that, but there is too little research being done to understand how infectious
diseases affect the sexes differently on a biological level. It's like
Groundhog Day each time a disease surges, and people are losing their lives because
of it. "We can't get past the 'interesting observation' stage," says Johns
Hopkins University professor Sabra Klein. Public
health officials generally gather data on age and sex in a crisis, but "nobody
goes somewhere with it."


Klein, who studies biology and immunology, explains that going
"somewhere" would mean consciously evaluating what happens in an
outbreak, or in any health crisis, through a gender lens. It would also mean
tackling systemic problems, such as women's unequal access to adequate health
care or the finances they might require for treatment. In short, it would mean
challenging fundamental and dangerous disparities.


Looking at who dies
in an outbreak "shows you who has power and who doesn't," says Columbia
University epidemiology professor Wafaa El-Sadr. "In a way, it holds a
mirror to society. And it shows societies how they treat each other."

As in many spheres, the funding, research, and thinking in
public health has long been geared toward white men. As Claudia García-Moreno, lead specialist in gender,
reproductive rights, sexual health, and adolescence at the WHO in Geneva, puts it, "When I was in medical
school, everything" -- drug dosages, public health scenarios -- "was
still defaulted for the '70-kilo white male.'" García-Moreno says that though this has changed somewhat, "it's still not what we would hope it
would be." 


García-Moreno points to a persistent lack of attention to
the "biological components" of disease. There are often basic
differences in how men and women respond to infection, Klein echoes, and those
can -- and should -- affect medical responses in the short and long terms. Take
influenza, for instance; according to Klein, "Inflammation caused by
infection is often greater for women than for men." Similarly, Anker noted in a 2011 WHO
report, "A frequent mistake is to undercount the relative importance of
symptoms that can only occur in one sex, such as vaginal bleeding in dengue."*


"You get these really interesting observations about
Ebola, too," Klein adds. "[Yet when] research funding is coming in
for Ebola, they will not even consider the role sex might play." 


As evidence of this sort of dismissal of gender's importance
in public health matters, Klein describes an anonymous note once included in a
review of a grant application she wrote. "I wish you'd stop with all this
sex stuff and get back to science," it read. "I've been in this field
for 20 years and this [biological difference] doesn't matter," another note
once stated. 


Throughout her career, Anker has been beating back against similar
faulty notions, though ones often rooted in social, as opposed to biological, issues.
"The general
belief has been that since infectious diseases affect both males and females,
it is best to focus public health attention during an outbreak on control and
treatment, and to leave it to others to address social problems that may exist
in society such as gender inequalities after an outbreak has ended," she
wrote in the 2011 WHO report. However, addressing these "problems"
can be critical to understanding and stemming an epidemic's spread.*


Consider nurses. They are primarily female worldwide, and they
are frequently at the forefront of dealing with infectious diseases. Yet very
often, they are too low on the social -- and gender -- totem pole for their
needs to be heard clearly. "Research
has shown that poor nurse-physician relationships are common in hospital settings,
pose a potential threat to patient safety -- including the risk of infections
[--] and have a negative impact on
nurse satisfaction and retention," the 2011 WHO report stated. Moreover, after
the 2003 SARS outbreak, Canadian studies found, according to the WHO,
that a "lack of power and influence of nurses was linked to infection
control deficiencies."


Considering gender more broadly, in one previous Ebola
outbreak, an anecdotal report claimed that men
dominated informational meetings on the disease, despite the fact that
women were already known to be primary caregivers. During
H1N1 (avian flu) outbreaks, government officials tended to deal with men because
they were thought to be the owners of farms, despite the fact that women often
did the majority of work with animals on backyard farms. And some dengue-control programs in Southeast Asia in the
early 1990s, according to one report, "met resistance"
because health workers "called into question the woman's ability to
preserve health by maintaining a household free of disease."


These problems are certainly entrenched. Yet with each new
outbreak or uptick of an infectious disease comes a chance to do things
differently. "Whether they be acute or chronic epidemics, they tend to
show the schisms and the vulnerabilities that exist [in a society]," says
Columbia's El-Sadr. "Maybe with Ebola it will bring to the fore the
weaknesses in the health system; it will bring to the fore the plight of people
who have been disenfranchised." 


"Maybe the lessons learned can help prevent the next
epidemic," she adds. 


With so many dying in West Africa, there is an opportunity
to go against the grain, to try to incorporate a much-needed gender lens into
medical and social responses. Now is the time to do it -- just like it was in the last
crisis.

 Is Barack Obama More of a Realist Than I Am?
This president isn't weak and waffling. He's calculating, coldhearted, and decisive when it counts.

IraqRussiaWarMiddle East 



I had a strange thought late last week, while chatting with
a colleague about the various hot spots that are dominating the news and
interfering with U.S. President Barack Obama's vacation. Is it possible, I
wondered, that Obama is craftier and more ruthless than I've realized? I've
been disappointed by a lot of his foreign-policy decisions, but have I
underestimated him? Far from being indecisive or too easily swayed by hawkish advisors,
might he be even more of a realist than I am?


An early hint came in the 2008 presidential campaign, when Obama
was asked to identify his
favorite movie. His answer was The
Godfather. His second favorite? The
Godfather, Part II. It was a revealing moment, borne out by subsequent
events. He followed the Godfather's advice when he appointed
Hillary Clinton secretary of state ("Keep your friends close, but your enemies
closer"), and his style as president resembles Marlon Brando's Don Corleone and
Al Pacino's Michael Corleone in many ways. They don't make many threats, they
never bluster, and they rarely raise their voices. But when the time comes,
they dispatch opponents with remorseless indifference and pay little attention
to who might get hurt in the process. "It's not personal; it's
strictly business."


At first glance, you might not see this approach in places
like Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Gaza, or East Asia. For some
commentators, the various upheavals and confrontations in these places are
signs that a more restrained U.S. policy has opened the door to instability and
even chaos. Pundits and policymakers from Roger
Cohen to Frank
Bruni to David
Brooks to Robert Kagan to Michèle
Flournoy and Richard Fontaine now bemoan American malaise and complain that
the pendulum toward disengagement is swinging too far. What these critiques
lack, of course, is a convincing explanation of how doing more in all these
trouble spots would make Americans safer or more prosperous. 


In fact, because the United States is already so powerful
and so secure, there is relatively little the United States could gain in most
of these situations, even if they were to turn out well. Furthermore, diving
back into the quicksand might easily make them worse. As Eurasia Group's Ian
Bremmer tweeted
on Aug. 12, "If the US had provided more
arms to the Syrian rebels, the most likely outcome would have been a stronger
ISIS." 


Equally important is that Obama's approach is causing more
trouble for America's various adversaries (and for some of its less cooperative
allies) than it is causing the United States, and at a rather low cost to the
United States itself. That's not a bad definition of a successful foreign
policy: If you can give opponents headaches without having to do very much,
what's not to like? The only downside is that innocent third parties end up bearing
most of the burden, which merely underscores the degree to which Obama's
approach is based on coldhearted realpolitik.


Let's start with Russia and Ukraine. The United States and
its European allies bear considerable (though not sole) responsibility
for causing the crisis in the first place, but the United States has so far
escaped any serious damage. Instead, the immediate
costs are being borne primarily by the people of Ukraine. The escalating
confrontation has also inflicted real pain on Russia and on the European Union,
whose fragile
recovery has been jeopardized
by the punitive sanctions imposed by the West. Russian President Vladimir Putin's
reputation abroad has suffered considerably (and with some justification), but
the short-term costs to the United States and to Obama himself have been
minimal. 


To be clear: I still think everyone would be better off if
the United States were pushing harder for a deal that guaranteed Ukraine's status
as a neutral buffer state, and the standoff makes it harder to get Russian
cooperation on other issues. But in the short term, Obama has succeeded in pinning
almost all of the blame on Putin, and it is mostly the Russians, Ukrainians,
and Europeans who are getting hurt in the process. 


Next, consider how Obama is dealing with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Obama took office in 2009 hoping to achieve that
elusive two-state solution, which he believed was essential to ensuring Israel's
long-term future. While pushing for an end to Israel's self-defeating
settlements policy, he also reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel in myriad ways
and bent over backward to be supportive. His reward for his efforts? He has been
repeatedly humiliated by Netanyahu, and his aides have been publicly maligned
by Israeli officials. And his diplomatic envoys (George Mitchell, John Kerry,
etc.) have gotten exactly bupkis for
their time-consuming efforts to advance the cause of peace. 


So what is Obama doing now? He's letting Netanyahu do pretty
much whatever he wants -- including pummeling Gaza to no real purpose -- even
when these actions damage Israel's legitimacy and hasten the arrival of the one-state
solution that most Israelis oppose. In other words, Obama seems increasingly
willing to watch Israel drive itself off a cliff, even though this policy
necessarily entails further suffering by the residents of Gaza. He has to
pretend to be sympathetic to Israel's plight in order to placate its lobby back
in the United States, but I wonder whether what's really going on is a
devilishly subtle form of payback. If so, Don Corleone would probably approve.


Which brings us to the Islamic State (formerly known as ISIS).
Unlike the reflexive threat-inflators who dominate the U.S. foreign-policy
establishment, Obama didn't panic over the emergence of this lightly armed
group of bloody-minded radicals whose new "caliphate" extends over a lot of
mostly empty territory. He recognized that this group is brutal and that its
recent advances need to be halted, but he also knew it wasn't the reincarnation
of the Soviet empire, Nazi Germany, or even Baathist Iraq. In particular, Obama
understood that the threat to the United States itself was neither large nor
imminent and that a permanent solution to the problem would require local
actors to step up. Instead of doing "the full McCain" and plunging back into
the quicksand, Obama has done just enough to give the Kurds and the Iraqi
government the opportunity to contain the problem themselves. 


Not only has he kept the United States off the slippery
slope -- at least so far -- but this policy convinced Iraqis to rid themselves of
divisive Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and pick someone who might govern more
effectively. As he has done before, Obama, in short, was essentially buck-passing,
a time-honored realist tactic. His measured response took advantage of the Islamic
State's brutality and overweening ambition, which convinced local actors with
far more skin in the game to get serious about dealing with the problem.


One can even see elements of this approach in Obama's
handling of China. He has repeatedly emphasized Asia's importance to the United
States, and the much-publicized "rebalancing" was obviously intended to signal
to America's Asian partners that it wasn't abandoning the region. Obama
reinforced these themes during his visit to Asia in April, but the
administration has implemented this policy at a measured pace, content to let
China's growing assertiveness do the work for us. Overreacting would alarm the
local powers and let them continue to free-ride, while speaking softly makes
present and future allies more eager for help and more willing to do what America
wants to get it. 


The common thread to these various responses is an
appreciation not just of the limits of U.S. power, but also of the limited need to exercise it. "Limited"
does not mean zero, which is why sensible people oppose a return to 19th-century-style
isolationism. But this approach recognizes that the overwhelming majority of
problems in the world do not threaten the United States directly and therefore
do not require an immediate, forceful, and potentially costly U.S. response. 


As Andrew Sullivan likes
to say, Obama's greatest political genius has been his Road
Runner-like ability to let
enemies beat themselves. It would be even easier to do this if the Republican
Party, the punditocracy, and some members of his own administration weren't
constantly pressuring him to venture abroad in search of monsters to destroy. But
I'm beginning to suspect that Obama understands America's privileged
international position better than they do and that he also has a better grasp
of where
the public is on these issues as well. He's not running an especially noble
foreign policy, but from a purely selfish U.S. perspective, it may be more
effective than I used to think.
