Liberia Battles Ebola Epidemic

Aug 19, 2014  | 



Tweet


 In West Africa, more than 2,200 people have contracted Ebola since March, and 1,200 of them have died from the virus. Liberia has suffered the most deaths to date, with teams of undertakers wearing protective clothing now collecting victims from all over the capital of Monrovia. Poor sanitation, close living quarters, and a lack of education have contributed to the spread of the virus. Among some, a belief has grown that the epidemic is a fraud, and that people are dying from other causes, leading to confrontations between citizens and health workers. Burial teams have been turned away while trying to retrieve bodies from neighborhoods, and isolation wards have been vandalized or overrun by mobs believing the Ebola virus is a hoax. Getty Images photographer John Moore has spent the past week in Liberia, documenting the situation as the country battles to halt the spread of Ebola while struggling to handle the huge rise of infectious, sick, and dying patients.

9 Public health advocates stage street theater to attract people to attend an Ebola awareness and prevention event on August 18, 2014 in Monrovia. The Liberian government and international groups are trying to convince residents of the danger and are urging people to wash their hands to help prevent the spread of the epidemic, which is spread by bodily fluids. Prevention steps on the sign include "Avoid physical contact with people showing signs and symptoms such as continuous high fever, red eyes, vomiting and stomach ache", "Keep away from bats, monkeys, baboons and dead animals", and "Avoid eating bush meat, cook all food very well."
