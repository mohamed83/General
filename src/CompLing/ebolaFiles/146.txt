Published on Sep 23, 2014


Sierra Leone's president said Tuesday that health workers found "many sick people and corpses" during a three-day lockdown of the country, which is battling an unprecedented Ebola outbreak.The Friday-through-Sunday lockdown — believed to be the most dramatic disease-control measure taken since the plague was sweeping Europe in the Middle Ages — was so successful that a second one is being considered to slow Ebola's spread, President Ernest Bai Koroma said.The Ebola outbreak is believed to have sickened more than 5,800 people and killed more than 2,800 in West Africa, primarily Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The World Health Organization has warned that these figures are likely underestimates. The unprecedented size and sweep of the outbreak has led to dramatic measures, like the cordoning off of entire communities in Liberia and the shutdown in Sierra Leone.http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281...http://www.wochit.com
