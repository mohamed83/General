      UPDATE: For updated information on Ebola and infection control, read our follow-up article here.
The recent Ebola outbreak is the worst outbreak in 40 years, since first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in Central Africa. On Friday, August 8th, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola outbreak an international health emergency to focus worldwide attention on preventing spread of the virus, which has claimed over 960 lives throughout Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leona and Nigeria.
The CDC created a simple yet very important infographic to increase awareness and educate others about this Ebola.
Remember, you CANNOT:
Get Ebola through air
Get Ebola through water
Get Ebola through food
You can get Ebola, however, if you come in contact with bodily fluids of someone who has died or is sick with Ebola. Also, needles and other objects may become contaminated with the virus.
CDC provides infection-control specifications for hospitals, which include but are not limited to:

Separating the infected patients from others
Provide protection to its staff (gloves, body covers)
Reduce aerosol-generating procedures
Cleaning and disinfection of blood, sweat, feces and other bodily fluids
>> Download and share the infographic


The CDC ensures that this virus is not a risk in the United States and experts are saying not to worry about an outbreak in the US.
