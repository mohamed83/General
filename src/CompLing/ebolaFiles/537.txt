Sierra Leone News: Peace Corps volunteers leave Sierra LeoneA total of 130 Peace Corps volunteers left Sierra Leone from Lungi International Airport Friday evening, in what the organization is calling a “temporary removal” due to the increasing spread of the Ebola virus. The Volunteers departed Bo, Friday morning, from where they travelled to Port Loko before making their final trek to Lungi. Using multiple different airplanes, the volunteers began to leave the country at approximately 5:00 pm. This comes, following the organization’s announcement on July 30, that it would be removing its volunteers from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, in response to the on-going threat of Ebola in the region. Two volunteers are currently under observation before they can be cleared to return to the United States after coming into contact with a now-deceased victim of the disease in Liberia. The Peace Corps has reiterated that this removal is only temporary but has been unspecific as to when the volunteers will return to the three West African countries, stating that “a determination on when volunteers can return will be made at a later date.”Before this declaration was made, 340 volunteers were stationed throughout Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. 130 volunteers in Sierra Leone and 108 volunteers in Liberia were working on education projects, while the 102 volunteers in Guinea were working on projects relating to education, agriculture and health. According to a statement released last Thursday on the organization’s official website, the Peace Corps “will continue to closely monitor the situation in collaboration with leading experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of State.”Since the outbreak began, three U.S. citizens have contracted the virus and one has died. Medical workers Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol contracted the disease while working in Liberia and remain in serious condition. Patrick Sawyer, who was working as a consultant for Liberia’s finance ministry and had citizenship in both the U.S. and Liberia, died last week following a flight from Monrovia to Nigeria’s capital city of Lagos.

Ebola outbreak: BA suspends flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia over virusBritish Airways says the 'deteriorating public health situation' relating to the Ebola virus is why they have suspended flights until August 31Ebola outbreak: BA suspends flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia over virusBA suspends flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia  Photo: AlamyBy Colin Freeman, and Raziye Akkoc4:23PM BST 05 Aug 2014British Airways cancelled its flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia, cutting off the only direct flights between Britain and the Ebola-infected area of west Africa.The carrier, which operates a direct flight four times a week from London to Sierra Leone and onto Liberia, announced on Tuesday it was suspending flights "due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries".It follows warnings at the weekend from the World Health Organisation the epidemic, which has killed nearly 900 people since February, was spreading faster than it could be controlled.Health officials are believed to be particularly concerned about Liberia, where staff are understood have fled hospitals in some areas because of fears they themselves could become infected.A statement from British Airways sent to travel companies on Tuesday said: "British Airways services from London Heathrow to Freetown and Monrovia will be temporarily suspended from tomorrow, 6 August until 31 August 2014, due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries."'It couldn’t be Ebola, could it?’ 03 Aug 2014In a statement to ITV News, a spokesman for the airline said: "The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the route under constant review in the coming weeks."Customers with tickets on those routes are being offered a range of options including a full refund and the ability to rebook their flights to a later date."The BA move follows that of a number of other international airlines serving the two countries, as well as neighbouring Guinea, which is also affected.Emirates Airlines suspended flights to Guinea earlier this month and Pan-African airlines Arik and ASKY suspended flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone.Other airlines are continuing to operate to all three nations at the present time.The news comes as Public Health Wales (PHW) says an individual may have been exposed to the virus while visiting western Africa. Press Association reported they are being monitored by health officials who will do so for up to 21 days.PHW said there were no current cases of Ebola in the country.Health officials revealed an American who died of Ebola in Nigeria is now believed to have infected at least eight other people with the disease.Patrick Sawyer, who held joint American and Liberian citizenship, died of Ebola in the Nigerian capital, Lagos, shortly after arriving at the airport in July.In what appears to be a case study in how easily the disease can spread, Nigeria's health commissioner, Jide Idris, said all of the eight suspected cases of Ebola to have been documented in Lagos involved people who had been in contact with Mr Sawyer. So far two of those people had been confirmed as having the disease, one of them a doctor who had looked after him.Since Mr Sawyer's case emerged, Nigerian health officials have been attempting to track down and monitor anyone who came into contact with him, particularly on the planes that he had travelled on, where other passengers would have been at higher risk of exposure in an enclosed environment.Six other people who are known to have made contact with Mr Sawyer have been put in quarantine but are not yet showing symptoms. It was not clear whether the infected people had been in touch with Mr Sawyer before or after his plane journey.A specially-equipped charter plane has taken Nancy Writebol, an Ebola-stricken American aid worker, to the Atlanta hospital where her colleague Dr Kent Brantly is currently receiving treatment.They will receive specialist medical treatment at an infectious diseases centre in Atlanta, Georgia.There is no treatment or vaccine for Ebola, but both US patients have received an experimental serum. However, the president of the missionary group that Ms Writebol works for said it was having less of an effect on her than Mr Brantly."She's in a more weakened condition", Bruce Johnson told CNN on Monday.Separately, doctors in New York were running tests on a patient who was hospitalised with high fever symptoms similar to those of Ebola, which include vomiting, diarrhea, fever and sometime bleeding.The man had recently travelled to West Africa. However, David Reich, a spokesman for the Mount Sinai Hospital, said: "Odds are this is not Ebola. It's much more likely it's a much more common condition."The World Bank has pledged up to £120 million ($200 million) to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to help those nations contain the outbreak. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviatio ... virus.html

Germany advises against travel to Ebola-hit countriesBERLIN Tue Aug 5, 2014 3:50pm EDT(Reuters) - Germany has strongly advised against travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone due to the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, saying there was still no end in sight to the spread of the highly contagious disease.Nearly 900 people in West Africa have died since February of Ebola, for which there is no known cure and no vaccine to protect against infection."It cannot be ruled out further restrictions will be placed on the ability to leave Sierra Leone/Liberia/Guinea," the German foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.It did not include Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, in its travel advice. Nigeria announced on Tuesday eight suspected Ebola cases, all involving people who had come into contact with a man who died in Lagos last month after arriving from Liberia.The Ebola outbreak began in the forests of Guinea but is now spreading fastest in neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia.The United States has already warned against any non-essential to countries affected by Ebola. On July 31, France also warned travelers to cancel any trips to countries affected by Ebola, namely Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.(Reporting by Michelle Martin and Daniel Flynn in Dakar; Editing by Gareth Jones)http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/ ... 8H20140805

Madrid will send an air force plane to Liberia to bring an elderly Spanish missionary infected with Ebola back to Spain for treatment, the defence ministry said late Tuesday.Defence Minister Pedro Morenes has ordered the preparation of a "medicalised" Airbus A310 which will be sent to the West African nation to retrieve the missionary, the defence ministry said in a Twitter message.The plane should be ready to take off from 5:00 am (0300 GMT) on Wednesday, the ministry added.The defence ministry did not say when the missionary would arrive back in Spain or where he would be taken for treatment for the deadly hemorrhagic fever.Miguel Pajares, a 75-year-old Roman Catholic priest, tested positive for Ebola at a hospital in the Liberian capital Monrovia where he worked, the aid organisation he works for said earlier on Tuesday.He has been in quarantine at the Saint Joseph Hospital in Monrovia, along with five other missionaries, since the death on Saturday of hospital director from Ebola.Pajares has worked in Liberia for over five decades, the last seven years at the Saint Joseph Hospital.Two other women who were also in quarantine, one from Congo and the other from Guinea, also tested positive for Ebola, Spanish aid organisation Juan Ciudad ONGD said in a statement.During an interview broadcast on Monday, Pajares said he and the other missionaries in quarantine would like to be taken to Spain for treatment."I have a fever. I don't have any appetite, I could go without eating anything, I have a lot of pain in my joints. I need help to move from one place to the other," he told CNN en Espanol, a 24-hour Spanish-language news network."We hope that we can be evacuated. For us it would be a huge joy because if we are taken to Spain we would be in good hands and we could get better, God willing," he added.Two Americans who worked for Christian aid agencies in Liberia and were infected with Ebola while taking care of patients in Monrovia were brought back to the United States for treatment in recent days.Both patients were flown home on a Gulfstream private jet which had been fitted with a collapsible, mobile isolation unit designed to transfer employees from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) exposed to contagious diseases.Over 1,600 people who have been infected with the hemorrhagic fever in West Africa since March, marking the largest outbreak of Ebola in history.A total of 887 people have died of the virus in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, a 55 percent fatality rate, according to the World Health Organisation.The World Bank has pledged up to $200 million to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to help contain the outbreak.Ebola is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.https://uk.news.yahoo.com/spanish-missi ... ml#7tVVTyb

Ebola Outbreak: Missionary Doctor Tells Congress 95% Of Doctors Fled LiberiaBy Dennis Lynch@neato_itsdennison August 07 2014 4:02 PMVolunteers carry bodies in a centre run by Medecins Sans Frontieres for Ebola patients in Kailahun July 18, 2014. Hundreds of troops were deployed in Sierra Leone and Liberia on Monday to quarantine communities hit by the deadly Ebola virus, as the death toll from the worst-ever outbreak reached 887 and three new cases were reported in Nigeria. Picture taken July 18, 2014. REUTERS/WHO/Tarik Jasarevic/Handout via ReutersA doctor with experience in Liberia told Congress Thursday that “95 percent of the expatriate doctors” working in the country left when the Ebola virus broke out in March.Dr. Frank Glover, who worked with the Christian charity SIM in Liberia for more than three years, testified before a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that immediate action is needed to stem the outbreak, lest the death toll reach “in the thousands.” He said more resources are needed at the source in West Africa if officials hope to end the worst Ebola outbreak in history.“This Ebola outbreak in Liberia has exposed the country’s inherently weak health system,” Glover testified. “Less than 200 doctors existed in this country of 4 million people prior to this epidemic. After the outbreak in March of this year, that number plummeted to only 50 doctors.”Doctors Without Borders stated in late June that it has “reached the limit of what it can do” in response to the virus, and has since reiterated how dire the situation is. The group called on the U.N.'s World Health Organization to step in, which it since has. Still, according to Glover, the world's response so far isn’t adequate to stamp out the outbreak.“Many patients are dying with Ebola in their communities, in part, because there are simply no open health facilities. This creates problems, because whole families are getting infected and dying.  Given the episodic nature of Ebola, we must begin investing in health care systems, strengthening as we prepare to deal with future outbreaks,” the doctor told the committee.WHO reported Wednesday that 932 people, nearly all in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, have now perished in the four-month epidemic. Another 108 cases were reported Saturday through Monday. Nigeria now has a handful of suspected cases after a Liberian-American flying in from Monrovia fell ill at the Lagos airport and died in a Nigerian hospital. A nurse treating him died earlier this week. Then a Saudi man died with Ebola-like symptoms in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. If his tests come back positive, it would be the first case of Ebola spreading beyond Africa.Two American medical missionaries who worked with Samaritan’s Purse and SIM are being treated in a state-of-the-art facility at Emory University in Atlanta. Two other suspected cases in U.S. hospitals came out negative.http://www.ibtimes.com/ebola-outbreak-m ... ia-1652322

Ugh! Not great PPE on these folks handling the dead. Wonder how the bodies are contained, under those covers. Even the WHO person is unprotected, as he walks by. -k
