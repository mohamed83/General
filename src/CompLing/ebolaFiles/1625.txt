Nigeria's health ministry has reported two more cases of Ebola, bringing the country's total to 15.
Officials said Thursday that a man working for the Economic Community of West African States recovered from an Ebola infection without treatment, but that his doctor died last week from the virus.
Six people have now died from Ebola in Nigeria during the latest outbreak.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported Thursday the virus has killed at least 1,550 people and infected more than 3,000. The majority of cases have been in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
The WHO said Wednesday that 80 people are also being monitored for Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo in an outbreak that is not related to the one in West Africa.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is providing an additional $5 million to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. 
The new funding will be used for health equipment, training of health care workers and support of public outreach campaigns.
USAID has now committed nearly $20 million to combat Ebola since the outbreak was first reported in March.
A shortage of protective equipment is one of the factors contributing to the epidemic.

                    America’s top military commander says Islamic State militants are adapting to a U.S.-led air campaign, making targets in Iraq and Syria harder for coalition forces to identify and eliminate.  VOA’s Michael Bowman reports, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, spoke one day after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel described the task of defeating the Islamic State group as “difficult” and “complicated.”

 Camp David Peace Accords Get Fresh Look in Book, Play


                        Jimmy Carter’s popularity plummeted at the end of his presidency, as his administration struggled to free hostages taken by Iranian revolutionaries. The hostage crisis ultimately overshadowed one of his greatest achievements, negotiating a 1978 peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.  As VOA’s Kane Farabaugh reports, a new book and play provide a unique look at what it took to create lasting peace between two historic enemies.

 Kurds See War-Ravaged Kobani As Political, Emotional Heartland


                        Intense fighting is continuing between Islamic State militants -- also known as ISIS or ISIL -- and Kurdish forces around the Syrian town of Kobani, on the Turkish border. The U.S. said it carried out at least nine airstrikes against Islamic State positions Friday.  Meanwhile the U.N. has warned that hundreds of civilians would be massacred if the town falls to the militants. Henry Ridgwell looks at the strategic significance of the city.

 A Day with Sierra Leone’s First Ebola Burial Team


                        In West Africa, traditions are suffering in the time of Ebola, as important burial rites are bypassed. Since June, Sierra Leone's government has decreed all deaths be treated as suspect and should only be handled by trained Ebola teams. Adam Bailes reports for VOA News from Kailahun, where Sierra Leone's first body management team was established and remains hard at work.

 "Kill the Messenger" Explores Media-Government Relationship


                        Freedom of the press and using drug money to fund a war are the main subjects in Michael Cuesta’s film "Kill the Messenger." It is based on the true story of journalist Gary Webb, who was discredited after writing newspaper articles about the source of money the United States used to fund the fight against Nicaragua's communist government. VOA’s Penelope Poulou has more.

 VOA Exclusive: Turkish Troops Fire on Kurdish Protesters


                        Syrian Kurdish protesters in the border town of Qamishli come under fire from Turkish forces this week, in an incident Ankara says was provoked by the demonstrators. But in exclusive video captured by VOA Kurdish service reporter Zana Omer, it is far from clear who is to blame. VOA's Elizabeth Arrott has this report.
