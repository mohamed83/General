THE WORLD
SCOTLAND: “If you had told someone in 2012 that in just two years the eurozone would remain bonded together but the United Kingdom might not, they would have thought you insane. But here we are. It’s been a good three centuries, but now Scotland may want out of the United Kingdom. The stakes are enormous for Scotland, and quite high for the rest of Britain. … The latest polling on the referendum, to be held Sept. 18, points to a narrow edge for Scots who wish to pull out of the state that they have been part of since 1707 and go it as a nation of their own. Previous polls, by contrast, had given the edge to those who wish for Scotland to remain part of Britain. Both betting markets and forecasting groups are now putting the odds that Scotland will pull away and form its own state at something like 30 percent. What’s all the more remarkable about this possible secession is that major, specific grievances over public policy between Scotland and the rest of Britain are hard to identify. This isn’t like the Southern chunk of the United States seceding in 1860 because it was committed to slavery and the North was against it.”
“…Sure, the pro-independence leaders make some promises about improving social welfare benefits like improved public child care for young children. But that doesn’t square particularly well with the fact that Scotland has been a net drain on the rest of British taxpayers for the last generation; it has received greater benefits than it has paid in taxes. And whatever long-term arrangements are reached over thorny issues like oil rights, divvying up public debt and currency arrangements between the Independent Scotland and the “rump U.K.,” as British commentators have been calling the possible post-secession nation, there is sure to be a heavy transition cost and damage to commerce in the near term. Many Scots feel as if they have more to gain from governing alongside people who look like them and talk like them than they have to lose from no longer being part of a bigger, more powerful nation. A video posted by the pro-independence campaign captures a bit of this. Amid soft-focus images of beautiful Scottish landscapes and charming-looking Scots going about their day, a woman holding flowers says: “Independence. It’s what we all want in our lives. So why shouldn’t our country be independent too?”” Read more from the NYT.

SMART PHONE ADDICT: “If a new study from Baylor University is to be believed, college women spend an incredible ten hours a day futzing around on their cell phones — and the guys aren’t far behind, losing eight hours each day the same way. And perhaps not surprising, in that same study, about 60 percent of the college students said they felt “addicted” to their phones. The researchers, led by Baylor marketing professor James Roberts, surveyed 164 students about the things they did on their phones and how much time they spent doing them. Among their findings: The students who spent more time on Facebook and Pinterest were more likely to report feeling addicted to the phones than those who played more games.” Read more from NY Mag.

MILLENNIAL SPENDING: “Just how different are millennials?  So far, quite. They are spending money differently than previous generations, preferring to throw cash at new experiences and adventures and to reward socially responsible companies that they can connect with and that they deem authentic. It’s easiest to see this change in the food industry, where millennials are helping to disrupt the landscape of casual restaurants and boosting the earnings of chains such as Chipotle or Panera. As 2013 research from the Boston Consulting Group found, millennials anticipated spending the greatest amount of money in the coming year on fresh fruits, organic food, and natural products. Less favorable, in their minds, was the idea of spending on luxury goods, soda, applications, and handbags.” Read more from the Atlantic. (h/t Kari)

TWITTER NEWS: “Twitter is already a real-time emporium for news, photos, video clips and 140-character snippets of thought. Now, the real-time social network wants to be a shopping mall for real products, too.

The feature — initially limited to mobile versions of Twitter and aimed at selling limited-edition or time-sensitive items like T-shirts and event tickets — could eventually create a new revenue stream for the social network, which currently relies on advertising for virtually all of its income.” Read more from the NYT.

It will take requests for rides through an app, and dispatch drivers sporting hot pink pashmina scarves. The service will be called SheTaxis — SheRides in New York City because of regulations barring it from using “taxi” in its name — and aims to serve women who may feel uncomfortable being driven by men, or who simply prefer the company of other women. The app will ask potential riders if there is a woman in their party. If not, they will be automatically redirected to other car services.” Read more from the NYT. (h/t Jess)

NO IMMIGRATION REFORM: “Republicans had been licking their chops for weeks, hoping President Barack Obama would actually carry through on his immigration promise. They had polled the issue in a handful of key races and come to a clear conclusion: If Obama circumvented Congress and acted alone this summer on immigration, conservative and independent voters would finally have an issue to rally behind and give the GOP a clear opportunity to nationalize the midterms in states where the president is deeply unpopular. So Obama’s major reversal Saturday, announcing that he would not act alone on immigration until after the midterms, came as a huge sigh of relief for party operatives and candidates clinging to a tenuous Senate majority. … The question, however, is will the delay work? The White House is betting control of the Senate will turn on more local issues and that its strategy of kicking the can down the road on immigration won’t keep its Democratic base at home on Election Day.” Read more from Politico.

IN POLITICS
THE GOP AND CONTRACEPTION: “Politics is mostly about both parties regurgitating well-established positions (on taxes, the environment, abortion and spending, for example) to appeal to base voters and demonize their opponents. But every so often, candidates from one party try a dramatically new message. That’s what is happening now in a number of swing districts and states, as a handful of Republicans have come out in favor of allowing contraceptives to be sold over the counter. The position was initially taken by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal in a December 13, 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed, “The End of Birth-Control Politics.” In the piece, Jindal said the use of birth control “is a personal matter — the government shouldn’t be in the business of banning it or requiring a woman’s employer to keep tabs on her use of it.” At the end of his op-ed, the governor said that it was “hogwash” that Republicans were “against birth control and against allowing people to use it.” In fact, the anti-abortion movement has tied birth control and abortion together in the past, so it is noteworthy that at least a handful of generally conservative Republicans who oppose legal abortion have started to embrace Jindal’s position on contraceptives.” Read more from CQ Roll Call.
GAY MARRIAGE: “The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday overturned same-sex marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. “The discrimination against same-sex couples is irrational, and therefore unconstitutional even if the discrimination is not subjected to heightened scrutiny, which is why we can largely elide the more complex analysis found in more closely balanced equal-protection cases,” Judge Richard Posner wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. The ruling makes it the third federal appeals court to conclude that state prohibitions on gay marriage violate the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. Advocates for marriage equality have enjoyed many victories since the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the federal government may not deny equal benefits to legally married gay couples.” Read more.

ISIS: “At least 28,000 Twitter accounts supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) have been set up since the beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to a Web intelligence firm. Twitter vowed to suspend accounts posting graphic imagery or “calls to violent actions” after Foley’s murder was filmed by the Sunni group and then spread online last month. But an analysis by Recorded Future that carried out for Britain’s Sky Newsshowed 60,000 pro-jihadi profiles had been set up since May, including 28,000 since the video of Foley’s murder emerged on August 20. And in the 24 hours after video was released showing U.S. reporter Steven Sotloff’s murder by ISIS, 10 percent of all references to the footage were positive, the analysis showed. ISIS has employed Twitter, sophisticated videos and professional-sounding music recordings to spread its message around the world in a way not seen before in militant organizations.” From NBC News.

ONE BIG DINOSAUR: “Scientists have discovered the fossilized remains of a new long-necked, long-tailed dinosaur that has taken the crown for largest terrestrial animal with a body mass that can be accurately determined. Measurements of bones from its hind leg and foreleg revealed that the animal was 65 tons, and still growing when it died in the Patagonian hills of Argentina about 77 million years ago. “To put this in perspective, an African elephant is about five tons, T. rex is eight tons, Diplodocus is 18 tons, and a Boeing 737 is around 50 tons,” said study author and paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara at Drexel University. “And then you have Dreadnoughtus at 65 tons.”” Read more from the Washington Post.

GOP’S SEPTEMBER PLAN: “Speaker John A. Boehner outlined the September legislative agenda in a Wednesday afternoon conference call with House Republican lawmakers, describing a scheduled 12-day session that will be “brief, but busy.” The most pressing item on the agenda is a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown on Sept. 30, but Boehner also spoke strongly and at length, according to a read-out from a source on the call, in favor of using the remaining legislative days before the November elections to draw “a very stark contrast between ourselves and the Democrats who run Washington.”” Read more from CQ Roll Call.

ON THE BORDER: “The number of immigrant children caught alone illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States continued to decline in August, according to figures disclosed Wednesday by the Homeland Security Department. Last month Border Patrol agents apprehended 3,129 children, mostly from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. In July agents found more than 5,400 children, while in June the number was more than 10,600. The Obama administration has been cautious about speculating over what led to the recent decline, saying several factors are likely at play. Historically, the number of immigrants caught crossing the border illegally declines during the hottest summer months. Since the start of the budget year in October, more than 66,000 unaccompanied children have apprehended crossing the border illegally, nearly double the number from the 2013 budget year.” Read more from Yahoo.
THE WORLD
THREE FRONTS: “In vowing in Estonia on Wednesday to defend vulnerable NATO nations from Russia “for as long as necessary,” President Obama has now committed the United States to three major projections of its power: a “pivot” to Asia, a more muscular presence in Europe and a new battle against Islamic extremists that seems very likely to accelerate. American officials acknowledge that these three commitments are bound to upend Mr. Obama’s plans for shrinking the Pentagon’s budget before he leaves office in 2017. They also challenge a crucial doctrine of his first term: that a reliance on high technology and minimal use of a “light footprint” of military forces can deter ambitious powers and counter terrorists. And the commitments may well reverse one of the critical tenets of his two presidential campaigns, that the money once spent in Iraq and Afghanistan would be turned to “nation-building at home.””
“…But the accumulation of new defensive initiatives leaves open the question of how forcefully Mr. Obama is committed to reversing the suspicion, from Europe to the Middle East to Asia, that the United States is in an era of retrenchment. In his travels in Europe this week and a lengthy tour of Asia planned this fall, the president faces a dual challenge: convincing American allies and partners that he has no intention to leave power vacuums around the globe for adversaries to fill, while convincing Americans that he can face each of these brewing conflicts without plunging them back into another decade of large military commitments and heavy casualties.” Read more from the NYT.
TURKEY: “Turkey is struggling to close a “jihadist highway” that lets foreign militants slip across its border into Syria, amid pressure from Western governments and mounting security fears at home. Turkish forces have stepped up arrests, patrols and interrogations in recent months, but the rapid advance of Islamic State extremists in Iraq has made Ankara’s initiative even more urgent, say Turkish officials, Western diplomats and residents. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama signaled an expansion of American aims in the effort to halt Islamic State, saying the U.S. would “degrade and destroy” the extremist group and turn it into “a manageable problem” with the help of international partners. Turkey became the primary route for foreign jihadists to join Syria’s civil war because of the country’s easy visa policies for travel, its porous 565-mile border with Syria and its modern transportation infrastructure.” Read more from the WSJ.

CHINA: “With its stock near a high and its latest iPhone expected to be introduced on Tuesday, Apple is facing fresh accusations of violations of labor rights and workplace safety at a supplier in China. The allegations involve employees at a factory in the eastern China city of Suqian that is owned by Catcher Technology, a Taiwan company, and that makes metal casings for Apple iPads and for other consumer electronics companies. The employees are made to work excessive overtime and handle toxic chemicals without proper protective clothing, according to a report released Thursday by Green America, an environmental nonprofit group, and China Labor Watch, a workers’ rights group based in New York. Apple, like Samsung and several other multinational companies, has previously faced scrutiny over the working conditions at the factories in China where its products are made. But the allegations in the latest report suggest that the company might need to increase its vigilance further down the chain, among the 200 major global suppliers that account for 97 percent of Apple’s component costs.” Read more from the NYT.

EMOJI LAND: “Emoji. There are just never enough. The little, colorful pictograms were born in Japan in the late 1990s. Though they grew in popularity, for awhile it was impossible for people outside of the country to use the images. They needed a new coding system, one that enabled all kinds of programs to universally read emoji the same way. That’s where the Unicode Consortium stepped in. The non-profit organization created a global standard for coding the characters. That’s why you and someone in Japan can both see emojis on your smartphones in almost the same way. But who is this collective of techies who banded together to bring emoji to the masses? Over the years, companies like Apple and Google have joined the consortium, completing the majority of the work needed to keep up emoji standards. In addition, they’ve been creating new emoji along the way, albeit infrequently or in batches. Who decides which emoji get created? And what does the process entail? Is the non-profit archetype really the best model for a job that requires constant work and upkeep? Much the consortium’s process happens under a veil — most outsiders don’t understand the hows and whys of Unicode design choices.” Read more from Mashable.
HIGH TECH FORKS: “I am sitting in a restaurant tucked away on a quiet street in Tribeca, stabbing at overpriced Brussel sprouts with a neon green “smart fork” approximately four times the size of a regular fork. Bankers in cuff links have already gathered around the bar, their voices inching closer to maximum douche level with every Negroni, and I am trying to do my best impression of a normal human, pretending that using a comically oversize utensil to hoover vegetables into my mouth is a thing I totally do on the reg. As I raise the fork to my mouth to deliver another Brussel sprout, it starts to violently vibrate, and I almost drop it on the table. The hostess eyes me suspiciously. “That thing really needs to respect your journey,” my friend says from across the table as he happily cuts into his duck breast. He is eating with a regular fork, one that is not sending data about every bite he takes back to an app. For one dark, fleeting moment, I want to stab him with it.”
“…The devil fork is called the HAPIfork, but I immediately slip into calling it the “food-shaming fork,” and the name sticks. The moniker isn’t really fair — the fork doesn’t actually take into account what type of food you’re eating. Instead, it measures how quickly you eat, and zaps you with a Pavlovian vibration if you don’t take enough time between bites. It’s supposed to train you to eat slower, which studies have shown can help you feel fuller sooner, thus leading to weight loss. (This effect generally takes about 20 minutes.) The HAPIfork is one of many tech products on the market aimed at people who want to lose weight, stay fit, or narcissistically track every single thing they do in an OCD-friendly spreadsheet. Launched at CES in January 2013, the utensil attracted widespread derision outside of tech circles before going on to raise $134,743 on Kickstarter. AllThingsDdisparaged it as a tool for solving a first world problem, and Stephen Colbert even gave the HAPIfork a wag of the finger on an episode of his show that aired during CES.” Read more from the Cut.

IN POLITICS
FOLLOW THE MONEY: “The head of the investment bank that just hired Republican Eric Cantor for more than $1 million a year has been a loyal political supporter of the former House majority leader from Virginia. Ken Moelis, chairman and CEO of Moelis & Co., gave $5,000 to Cantor’s leadership political action committee, Every Republican is Crucial, just 12 weeks before he reportedly opened talks with Cantor about joining the bank. Moelis also personally gave the maximum $5,200 in this election cycle to Cantor’s campaign committee. Cantor’s new gig as vice chairman and managing director for the bank will earn him $400,000 this year, with a $400,000 signing bonus and $1 million worth of stock. The Cantor donations were among $100,000 that Moelis gave to Republican candidates and party committees in the 2012 and 2014 election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission data tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics. These include $19,800 to the National Republican Congressional Committee thus far in this election cycle, and $58,000 to the National Republican Senatorial  Committee in the 2012 elections. Also in 2012, Moelis gave $15,000 to the NRCC and the maximum $5,000 to GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.” Read more from CQ Roll Call.
POLICE CAMERAS: “In the wake of the tragic police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, there has been much speculation and debate about what actually transpired. Lots of news commentators seem to believe that the Brown case would be resolved sooner—and there would be less civil unrest—had the officer who shot him been equipped with a body-worn camera. In fact, the Ferguson Police Department has now begun to implement this technology. Cops wearing cameras is indeed a great idea, for all the reasons you might expect: The cameras have the potential to increase accountability, reduce complaints, and in some situations have a civilizing effect on the way police and citizens interact. It’s only a matter of time before police departments adopt them on a wide scale. The question isn’t if but when it will happen. But many assumptions people make about body-worn cameras simply aren’t true. We’re academics who have studied body cameras for years, and in our work we’ve identified three pervasive myths about the equipment. If police departments around the country are going to adopt the technology, then both law enforcement and citizens need to know about potential downsides as well.”
“…The first myth is that video evidence is completely objective and free of interpretation. … The second myth is that on-officer video cameras will be a silver bullet for improving the way police interact with citizens. While cameras can be helpful in some situations, most police work does not involve serious crime. … The last myth is that because on-officer video evidence is “objective,” it will help reduce civil unrest and controversy. On the contrary, it is possible that on-officer video creates a polarizing effect on some controversies because people with strong convictions about what has transpired during a police shooting may use the “facts” that they see in the video footage to support their expectations about what occurred in the blind spots.” Read more from Slate.

RAPE ON CAMPUS: “Emma Sulkowicz says she was raped in her own dorm bed by a classmate on the first day of her sophomore year of college. Since then, a substantial amount of her time at Columbia University has been spent trying to convince college administrators, police, and even friends that what happened to her really happened, that it was rape, and that her rapist deserves to be punished for what he did. Sulkowicz is one of 23 students who are part of a federal Title IX complaint filed against Columbia in April for mishandling sexual-assault cases. Though she and two other students reported that the same student had assaulted them, all of their claims were swept under the rug, and the male student was not expelled from campus.”
“…”Every day, I am afraid to leave my room,” Sulkowicz wrote in Time in May. “Even seeing people who look remotely like my rapist scares me. Last semester I was working in the dark room in the photography department. Though my rapist wasn’t in my class, he asked permission from his teacher to come and work in the dark room during my class time. I started crying and hyperventilating. As long as he’s on campus with me, he can continue to harass me.” Now a senior majoring in visual arts, Sulkowicz has devised a senior thesis rooted in performance art that will allow her to protest the fact that her rapist continues to study on campus. She has committed to carrying around a twin-size dorm mattress everywhere she goes on campus, to classes and appointments, “for as long as I attend the same school as my rapist.”” Read more from NY Mag.

4CHAN: “Over the weekend, hundreds of private photos from a number of female celebrities — including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton — were leaked by hackers to the messaging board 4chan. The act — besides being a horrible violation of the depicted celebrities’ privacy and a minimization of their talent — is a reminder of the huge influence 4chan still wields more than a decade after its creation. All the same, the site’s culture and history can be impenetrable to people who’ve never encountered it before. Here’s a basic guide to one of the Internet’s most infamous online communities. 4chan is, at root, nothing more than a collection of online forums of the kind that have existed in one form or another since the invention of the computerized bulletin board system in 1973. The site was created by Christopher Poole (better known by his username, moot), then a 15 year old high school student in the suburbs of New York City, on October 1, 2003.”
“…Unlike a lot of forum sites, 4chan doesn’t have user registration — everyone’s postings are entirely anonymous, or use a pseudonym chosen on the spot. And unlike a traditional bulletin board or community moderated sites like Reddit or Hacker News, posts are ordered reverse chronologically, as on a blog. 4chan claims to have 20 million unique visitors and 540 million page views a month. According to Alexa, it’s the 461st most popular website in the United States and the 974th most popular one in the world. Those are really impressive figures, but it’s less popular than some similar sites, most notably Reddit, which is the 18th most popular site in the US and 50th worldwide, and as of July 2014 claimed almost 115 million unique visitors and over 5 billion page views over the previous month.” Read more from Vox.

IN POLITICS
MAKING MOVES: “During his Congressional career, former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was well-known for raising large sums of money from Wall Street and fighting for its political priorities. So after his shocking primary defeat this June to a little-known challenger, it was widely expected that Cantor would take a lucrative Wall Street job.  And indeed, on Tuesday the investment bank Moelis & Company announced Tuesday that Cantor would join the firm as a vice chairman and managing director. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the firm’s founder Ken Moelis said that Cantor wouldn’t be just “a political figurehead” — he would instead be “a partner” and would open a new office for the firm in Washington, DC. Cantor will receive a multi-million dollar pay package over the next two years, according to an SEC filing flagged by Erik Schatzker of Bloomberg.”
“…Cantor’s victorious challenger Dave Brat campaigned, in part, on an anti-corporate, anti-Wall Street platform. “All the investment banks in the New York and DC — those guys should have gone to jail. Instead of going to jail, they went on Eric’s Rolodex, and they are sending him big checks,” Brat said during the campaign. It looks like Cantor has put that Rolodex to good use. He told the Journal that he met Moelis about three years ago — soon after Cantor became Majority Leader — and that they began discussions about a job in July, just weeks after Cantor’s loss. Cantor resigned his Congressional seat in August rather than serving out his term — all the better to get started at the bank quickly.” Read more from Vox. (h/t Kari)
OBAMA TO ESTONIA: “Can the Obama Doctrine neutralize the Putin Doctrine? Can it quash the terror threat from radical Islamic extremism? The answers may well depend on President Obama’s trip this week to Russia-bordering Estonia and a summit of NATO allies in Wales, perhaps the group’s most consequential meeting since the Cold War. Obama will arrive in Europe Wednesday determined to show that coalition-building and multilateral diplomacy is the best weapon against imminent security threats from a common enemy.  So far, the approach has done little to deter Russian incursions into Ukraine, or stunt the rise of Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. “What we are seeing is the old order not working, but the new order not being born yet,” Obama told donors at a private fundraiser Friday in New York. “And it is a rocky road through that process, and a dangerous time through that process.” A rocky and dangerous test, as a defiant Russian President Vladimir Putin asserts a right to defend ethnic Russians wherever they are and ISIS militants vow a fight to extend their caliphate across the globe.” Read more from ABC News.

BEHEADING: “The United States said Wednesday that a video showing the beheading of a second U.S. journalist by Islamic militants is authentic. Extremists from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on Tuesday released the video showing freelance reporter Steven Sotloff’s beheading, two weeks after the emergence of a video showing the killing of journalist James Foley. In the Sotloff video, a masked militant warns President Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, “Our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.” Sotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished a year ago in Syria and was not seen again until he appeared in the video that showed Foley’s beheading. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the Islamic State.” Read more from CBS.

SICK DAYS: “Got the flu? Or a new baby? Perhaps a little one with chicken pox? In most countries, your employer must pay your wages if you stay home sick or to care for others. Not in America. But a growing grass-roots movement aims to change that — starting with paid sick leave. Already the movement has met some success. This past weekend, California became the second state in the country to mandate sick leave for employees. Others may join soon. Sick-day measures are on at least a half-dozen ballots in November, including in Massachusetts, Oakland, Calif., and a few cities in New Jersey. At least six more states will take up the issue in 2015, including Colorado, Maryland and Vermont.” Read more from NPR.
WEEKEND SCANDAL RECAP: “It’s a late entry, and a sad one, but the trove of stolen celebrity nudes that hit Reddit like a bomb over the weekend may just qualify as the Internet story of the summer. After all, it’s the perfect Internet scandal: sex, Bitcoin, shadowy hackers and long-reigning Internet darling Jennifer Lawrence. And yet, the ongoing incident — which the FBI has said it’s investigating — is far more than a tawdry tabloid story. It also raises a lot of profoundly important issues about technology, security, privacy and power in the digital age. There are practical implications, as well: The leak is inspiring many inhabitants of the “cloud” — a club that, in all likelihood, you belong to — to take a second look at their security settings. Let’s parse the key questions.” Read more from the Washington Post.
GOOGLE NEWS: “A zipping comes across the sky. A man named Neil Parfitt is standing in a field on a cattle ranch outside Warwick, Australia. A white vehicle appears above the trees, a tiny plane a bit bigger than a seagull. It glides towards Parfitt, pitches upwards to a vertical position, and hovers near him, a couple hundred feet in the air. From its belly, a package comes tumbling downward, connected by a thin line to the vehicle itself. Right before the delivery hits the ground, it slows, hitting the earth with a tap. The delivery slows, almost imperceptibly, just before it hits the ground, hardly kicking up any dust. A small rectangular module on the end of the line detaches the payload, and ascends back up the vehicle, locking into place beneath the nose. As the wing returns to flying posture and zips back to its launch point half a mile away, Parfitt walks over to the package, opens it up, and extracts some treats for his dogs.”
“…The Australian test flight and 30 others like it conducted in mid-August are the culmination of the first phase of Project Wing, a secret drone program that’s been running for two years at Google X, the company’s whoa-inducing, long-range research lab. Though a couple of rumors have escaped the Googleplex—because of course Google must have a drone-delivery program—Project Wing’s official existence and substance were revealed today. … Taken with the company’s other robotics investments, Google’s corporate posture has become even more ambitious. Google doesn’t just want to organize all the world’s information. Google wants to organize all the world. During this initial phase of development, Google landed on an unusual design called a tail sitter, a hybrid of a plane and a helicopter that takes off vertically, then rotates to a horizontal position for flying around. For delivery, it hovers and winches packages down to the ground. At the end of the tether, there’s a little bundle of electronics they call the “egg,” which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle.” Read more from the Atlantic.

IN POLITICS
CRUZ LOOKING AT 2016: “Republican Sen. Ted Cruz sounds increasingly like he’s made up his mind to run for president in 2016, telling an influential gathering of conservative activists Saturday that “we are part of a grassroots fire that is sweeping this country.” “I’m convinced we’re going to win in 2014, and 2016 is going to be even better,” the Texas Republican said during a summit of Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the billionaire GOP donors Charles and David Koch. “And in the year 2017, a Republican president in the Rose Garden is going to sign a bill repealing every word of Obamacare.” Cruz joked about inviting President Barack Obama to the border to see where thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children have poured into the U.S. The president declined such an invitation from Texas Gov. Rick Perry.” Read more from the AP.
BIG MONEY: “House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) is likely the richest member of Congress, according to an analysis by The Hill. Issa, the former CEO of a car alarm company, had at least $392 million in financial assets at the end of 2013, according to a financial disclosure form he filed over the summer. Although the Republican’s net worth has fallen $38 million from 2012, Issa’s wealth remains a step above his peers. The lawmaker who comes closest, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), reported having more than $118 million in assets at the end of 2013. Among the other richest members of Congress are Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), who had a minimum net worth of $118.1 million, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who had $93.4 million. Most of Issa’s wealth is held in investment accounts. The 60-year-old lawmaker had six assets worth more than $50 million each — down from seven in 2012 — and 11 assets worth at least $5 million each.  Issa made his fortune as the chief executive of Directed Electronics, which manufactures car alarms and other automotive products.” Read more from the Hill.

RELATED TO COLLEGE
EBOLA ON CAMPUSES: “With college students from countries hit by the Ebola outbreak entering the United States for a new school year, universities are downplaying the risk they might pose while admitting that they have limited ability to track students’ travels or their health. Schools know which students are from the affected countries — the primary ones are Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — and even the largest universities have no more than a few dozen. But most schools have no idea how many students, faculty and staff members may have visited the region over the summer. Some are trying to identify and question people who have been there recently, to take their temperatures and to ask them to watch for symptoms like fever and diarrhea for as long as three weeks. … The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not given any specific guidance to colleges about arriving students, but plans to do so, possibly next week. The agency has advised against unnecessary travel to the affected countries, which include Nigeria, and this has prompted many colleges to suspend study abroad programs there.” Read more from the NYT.

ALL THE REST
DRIVING HIGH: “As states liberalize their marijuana laws, public officials and safety advocates worry that more drivers high on pot will lead to a big increase in traffic deaths. Researchers who have studied the issue, though, are divided on the question. Studies of marijuana’s effects show that the drug can slow decision-making, decrease peripheral vision and impede multitasking, all of which are critical driving skills. But unlike with alcohol, drivers high on pot tend to be aware that they are impaired and they try to compensate by driving slowly, avoiding risky actions such as passing other cars, and allowing extra room between vehicles. On the other hand, combining marijuana with alcohol appears to eliminate the pot smoker’s exaggerated caution and it seems to increase driving impairment beyond the effects of either substance alone.”
“…Colorado and Washington are the only states that allow retail sales of marijuana for recreational use. Efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in Alaska, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Twenty-three states and the nation’s capital permit marijuana use for medical purposes. It is illegal in all states to drive while impaired by marijuana. Colorado, Washington and Montana have set an intoxication threshold of 5 parts per billion of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in pot, in the blood. A few other states have set intoxication thresholds, but most have not set a specific level. In Washington, there was a jump of nearly 25 percent in drivers testing positive for marijuana in 2013 — the first full year after legalization — but no corresponding increase in car accidents or fatalities.” Read more from the Christian Science Monitor.
