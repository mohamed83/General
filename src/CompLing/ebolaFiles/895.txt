Third American with Ebola won't receive experimental serum 
(CNN) – Another American infected with Ebola is back in the U.S for treatment. Dr. Rick Sacra is said to be in stable condition in the Nebraska Medical Center's biocontainment unit.
Sacra was not working directly with Ebola patients, and it is still unclear how he contracted the disease.
He will also not be treated with the ZMapp serum, an experimental serum used on two other Americans infected with Ebola, because of limited supplies.
"We all would hope that we would have more in the way of treatments for Ebola," said Dr. Beth Bell, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "There are very, very limited treatments available. They're all completely investigational, and they haven't really been used widely in people."

While the CDC is working hard to speed up testing and availability of new treatments, Bell said they will not be available in the near term of three to six months.
"However, there is a lot that can be done to improve the survival of Ebola patients. Things that we call supportive care, keeping them well hydrated, treating infections if they have infections, making sure their blood pressure is normal, and that they have good nutrition – all things ... that can make a very big difference in terms of improving survival for Ebola patients," said Bell.
The World Health Organization put the death toll from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa at more than 2,000.
