Biocontainment units were “prepared specifically to deal with this type of disease.” Other patients and faculty and staff members, he said, will be “completely protected and safe.” Sacra has had a number of complications from the disease but was able to get on the plane under his own power, according to Dr. Phil Smith, director of the biocontainment unit.Sacra is the third American missionary to be infected with Ebola while in Liberia to take care of patients. The other two, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly, were treated at Emory University in Atlanta and made full recoveries after receiving a new drug, ZMapp. A total of seven Ebola patients received ZMapp, but it is not known whether the drug aided their recovery. Five of them were later released from hospitals, including the two Americans and a British nurse discharged Wednesday. Two of the patients did not survive.The company that developed ZMapp says it has no more doses left. Dr. Angela Hewlett of the biocontainment unit said her team was looking into other products to use in Sacra's treatment. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the worst on record, and the death toll has surpassed 1,900, according to the World Health Organization.
