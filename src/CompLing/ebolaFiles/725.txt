Medical experts are currently accessing  the situation to ensure that appropriate care is delivered and consular assistance is being provided”.
The deputy chief medical officer, professor John Watson also added “The overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low, and we have robust, well developed and well tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts.
The victim is the first British person to test positive for Ebola, and is currently being assessed by medical experts to ensure that appropriate care is delivered.
