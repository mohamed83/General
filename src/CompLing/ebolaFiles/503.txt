Ebola: no cause for alarm, just concrete and coordinated actions 





by 

Federico Grandesso




        21.09.2014 - 19:58    


 




 



Italy’s health minister Beatrice Lorenzin, in an interview with New Europe, stresses the need for a Europe-wide response to the Ebola epidemic. The minister attended the high-level meeting in Brussels on September 15 that was organised to coordinate further steps in a European wide response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
New Europe: Are you worried about the new cases of Ebola in Nigeria and Senegal? What is the EU’s priority now?
Beatrice Lorenzin: It’s a border topic. We now have this case in Senegal and we are worried about it, but please, we don’t want to create a sense of alarm. The priority is to implement concrete actions needed because spreading fear is not going to solve the crisis. We don’t want to shift attention away from the real problem.
So, it is evident that we have to prevent the spread of Ebola beyond the borders where it started and stop it before it reaches the big cities. If it spreads to Dakar or Accra and other cities with millions of inhabitants moving and taking aeroplanes and ships, the problem will get bigger.
This is a strategic phase for the various organisations to take action in a concrete and operative way. In these countries we need now to organise a net to transport food, water and goods because this usual transport axes are now blocked and food is not arriving. Then we have to organise the healthcare assistance in a concrete way. We don’t need only the health operators, but also the manager who can manage the aid.
We are beyond a purely sanitary phase. We are now organising an operation of humanitarian and civil protection that needs different elements. From this point of view, we are always recognised as extremely expert.
 
New Europe: Can you please explain in detail what the next steps will be – after today’s meeting? Where are we now?
Unfortunately, we are only at the beginning. The information on the ground is telling us that the interventions of the first months by the WHO [World Health Organisation] gave us only epidemiologic data, but the situation now is out of control especially in Sierra Leone.  
We need to coordinate, on a global level, a list of interventions in the affected countries, especially Liberia, Sierra Leone and today with the cases in Nigeria and a possible extension in Senegal.  
First, we have to contain Ebola. But you need to understand that there are areas in these regions that are heavily affected. And the distances are very big. There are people living in [remote] villages. This requires a common effort on a global scale, but we have two problems on how to take action.
The first is the intervention in Africa, which is the most important. We need medical staff and infrastructure like military hospitals where we can treat people. We also need to isolate the affected areas with interventions in the villages. 
The second priority is to coordinate the humanitarian aid. This is why today’s meeting was also attended by the ministers for cooperation and development.
Then, there is also the issue about European heath security and this means how to evacuate our sanitary operators in the affected countries and how to coordinate the transport of our operators affected by Ebola. This week, before the informal Council meeting in Milan on September 22-23 where we will delve deep into the situation with all the ministers, we need to have precise data.
After this, we will have to know how many hospitals we have available in Europe and the exact number of available beds. But there’s not only Ebola. We will have to keep fighting against the other diseases like polio and tuberculosis, which can also spread to Italy, as well as meningitis. 
Finally, I would like to remind you that, as Italy, our minister for cooperation has earmarked €5m. There are also three NGO’s, the Spallanzani hospital units and a new programme with 90 new beds.
