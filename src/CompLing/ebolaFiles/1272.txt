A doctor and a pharmacist quarantined after they
showed symptoms similar to the Ebola Virus Disease
in Port Harcourt, the Rivers state capital, have been
allowed to return to their homes after testing
negative to the deadly virus.
However, a female patient, who like the doctor and
the pharmacist had direct contact with Dr. Ikechukwu
Enemuo, the doctor who died of the disease after he
treated an infected ECOWAS staff secretly in a hotel
room, tested positive to the virus.
Rivers State Health Commissioner, Dr. Samson
Parker, who briefed the media on Monday, said the
female doctor shared a room with the late Dr.
Enemuo at the Good Heart Hospital where he was
first treated
.
He also said that Enemuo’s sister, Chinyere, who fled
to Aba, has returned and is presently in quarantine at
an isolation facility.
“I told you yesterday that we had three patients, and
out of the three patients, the result came out; two of
them were negative and one was positive. The two
negative ones have now left the isolation centre but
we will repeat the tests because they are still within
the 21 days circle of the virus,” Parker said.
