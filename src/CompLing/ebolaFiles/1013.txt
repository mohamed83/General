Ghana will not record a single case of Ebola- Health Minister declares

Health Minister, Dr. Kwaku Agyemang-Mensah has declared, government is determined to ensure that not a single case of the deadly Ebola virus will be recorded in Ghana.Interacting with health officials in the Eastern Region, Dr. Agyemang-Mensah said a lot of effort is being made to ensure that the points of entry to the country are well secured to prevent any suspected case from entering. The visit was to ascertain the level of the region's preparedness to deal with the disease if recorded in the country.Ebola has claimed over 1,000 lives across West Africa particularly, in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria.But the Health Minister says much work is being done at facilities designated as holding centres to manage an outbreak of the disease should it be reported.“Ebola, we will talk about it but we will not see one,” the Minister proclaimed while calling for support from the public to compliment efforts by the government.“All of us must work together [because] this is not Ministry of Health palaver…and all of us must work very hard at the district level, regional level and the national level and if we do that with the support we are getting from government, I'm sure we'll be okay”.Meanwhile, Dr. Kwaku Agyemang-Mensah has vehemently refuted claims Ghana is not adequately prepared to contain the Ebola disease in case it hits the country.Government last week announced the release of GhÈ¼6,000,000 to fight the disease. Part of the money will be used to procure 10,000 personal protective equipment (PPE) for health officials.“When I hear people say we are not ready…I don't understand,” he wondered.“I've gone to Korle-Bu they have a system in place to deal with Ebola…they showed me a place where we can easily evacuate where they can isolate people,” he guaranteed.The Health Minister assured; “we are doing everything possible” to ensure Ghana is Ebola-free.In a related development, Eastern Regional Minister, Antwi Boasiako Sekyere condemned what he says is the eagerness of some people to see the deadly disease hit the country.“What is the meaning of that,” he questioned. The minister wants an end to this.     Story by Ghana | Myjoyonline.com | Jerry Tsatro Mordy | [email protected]Comments:This article has 1  comments, leave your comment.
