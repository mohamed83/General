ABU DHABI // A 35-year-old Nigerian woman suffering from advanced metastatic cancer travelling from Nigeria to India via Abu Dhabi has died, the Health Authority – Abu Dhabi announced on Sunday.During the transit phase at Abu Dhabi International Airport, the patient’s health deteriorated. Despite prompt medical assistance she could not be resuscitated, Haad said in a statement.At the time of resuscitation she had shown signs that may be consistent with Ebola virus infection. Nigeria is one of many West African countries battling to contain the virus that, as of last week, had killed 961 people, according to the World Health Organisation. Haad said in a statement that her existing medical condition provided an adequate medical explanation for her death. 
“Full safety and precautionary measures have been taken by the medical staff who attended the patient according to the World Health Organisation standards for dealing with suspected cases of infectious diseases,” the statement read.“In addition, all contacts of the patient [her husband, who was the only person sitting next to her on the plane, and five medics who resuscitated her] are in isolation pending the result of Ebola testing on the patient. They are all well with no symptoms.”
Last week, Etihad Airways said it was closely monitoring the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It continues to operate its daily flights to and from Nigeria, and is in contact with medical authorities in the region and around the world regarding the potential risks.The Ministry of Health assured the public that there is no risk to the community, to fellow passengers on the plane from Nigeria and those in the airport, reported state news agency Wam.
