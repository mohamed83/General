Ebola Epidemic 












There was a recent out break in West Africa. The Ebola outbreak could eventually exceed 20,000 cases, That would result in more than six times the number that is currently know. This was stated by the world health organization.



A new plan was devised by the U.N health agency. It is meant to stop the spread of Ebola. They are also assuming that the that the levels in poverty area can be higher than the numbers that they already have. If, he number is actually accurate.With suggestions that their can already be up to 12,000 cases already.



The numbers that they are suggesting surpasses any historic outbreak number of Ebola. In the pass the largest case was about 400, this was told by "Dr. Bruce Aylward, who's assistant director-general for emergency operations.





This is what is called a serious case of Ebola outbreak. Multiple places within this country has contracted this disease. It is not a secluded incident. This is the kind of environment that has been tackled in the past. It can also travel and spread with the people that are leaving this country to enter another. This makes the disease international. Ebola can become an issue for the larger cities with larger populations.



It is being said that 1,552 people have died from the killer virus from the 3,069 cases reported so far from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. There is at least 40% of the cases have been identified in the last three weeks. "The U.N stated that the outbreak continues to accelerate."



The plan is yo deal with the issue accurately and effectively so that they can slow down the spreading epidemic within six to nine months and prevent it from going across international waters.
