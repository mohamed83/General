 on October 15, 2013Format: Kindle Edition

  The thing that is most engaging about this story is its believability, which leads to the realization that it could really happen.  As a nation we have consistently been guilty of preparing to fight the last war.  Could the future be a biological catastrophe?  What are we doing to prevent this from happening?  We can only hope and pray that there is a real Bill and Aphrodite team out there watching our backs. Charles Faddis must be given full credit for not only writing another thrilling page-turner but also raising the alarm about the potential for biological Armageddon.  This is a fascinating read told by an expert in the field.

Caffa: Charles FaddisWhat would we do if Islamist terrorists decided to unleash an attack on the United States more catastrophic than the events of Sept. 11th? What would happen if this attack made the experiments done to many humans during WWII pale in comparison? What about a plague so devastating, do deadly that it might not be able to be stopped? One Professor Doctor delivers a hard case with something so deadly and horrific inside that it would cost him and others more than must their lives. What secrets are hidden within this case and carefully sealed and locked that the receiver would not chance allowing this doctor to survive? Reminding readers about the deadly Black Death that almost obliterated Europe and the Near East during the 14th century what author Charles Faddis relates in this novel will terrify readers, hopefully make up those in charge and remind us that we can never take our eyes off of the enemy for one minute.Bill and Aphrodite have just tied the marital knot when they are called away to help find a young man named Eddie for a dear friend and then save Bill's friend's nephew from the dangerous situation he has gotten himself into. Selling weapons, illegal human trafficking and other sorted crimes are just the beginning. As Bill finds himself on the trail of those in charge what he learns will terrify him and alert readers to the real mission. The clock races throughout this novel as hear the voices of those that would give their lives for God and for their cause. What they decided to do and have already implemented caused a great deal of people to come down with this plague, hospitals overcrowded with patients and the thought that this was just the beginning did more than send shock waves throughout our nation.Read more ›

      By

TOP 100 REVIEWER on February 16, 2014Format: Paperback

  ‘Caffa’ written by Charles Samuel Faddis is the third installment of the Aphrodite thriller series in which the two main heroes Bill and Aphrodite Boyle are trying to save the world from a pandemic, the ultimate weapon in the hands of deluded terrorists.Though I have not read the previous two installments, from what I could understand in the novel, and subsequently what I've read about the previous installments, it is not necessary to read prequels to enjoy this novel, although it helps reader to have a bit better understanding of the relationship between the characters and some references to the past which are mentioned in ‘Caffa’.The story of this book is related to the insane, though greatly conceived plan by retired senior officers of Pakistan’s Intelligence Agency to use American Muslim terrorists for spreading pneumonic plague into the US. The novel’s name is a reference to a historical event of besieged Crimean city of Caffa that was the source of the Great Plague destroying almost half of the population in Europe in the 14th century.On its pages, the author offers a story with excellent pace that keeps reader thrilled until the last page, offering plenty of excitement since the monstrous plan was perfectly conceived and precisely executed by religious fanatics which had planned to carry it out without hesitation to the very end. The biggest quality of the novel is that the author manages to take reader deep into the thinking of terrorists and led us on a journey around the world which is apparently a consequence of his rich personal experience working in the CIA.Hence Charles Samuel Faddis novel ‘Caffa’ is good thriller worth reading because of interesting theme and especially will appeal to those readers who love stories about catastrophic threats to humanity as a whole, because in this field, the author truly excels.

  In this book Mr. Faddis raises your adrenalin and never lets off the gas pedal. After reading Caffa one can only hope government officials in Washington also read it and pay greater attention to our security.

Excellent book ... a real thriller

  This is the best of the three novels written by Charles Faddis.  It is a thriller that you cannot put down.  I would say it is as good as Tom Clancy or James Patterson novels.  And knowing the background knowledge of the author, it makes one wonder how close we are to the events in the story.  Both Codename Aphrodite and Barbarosa were very good, but this one had me on pins and needles to find out what happens - from very early on in the book.  Reading all three is recommended; but if you can't read the first two, you would not be lost starting with this one.  What a great movie this would make, as would the other two novels.  I highly recommend it.

  Great read! A believable story that fits with current events and the fact that the terrorist plot is totally plausible makes you shiver!
