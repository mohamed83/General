As a result of this development, hospital sources said the few health workers available have been working for 24 hours in order to take care of patients in the isolated area.Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris, told some of our correspondents in Lagos on Wednesday that people in the isolation ward could die if they were not well managed, adding that government needed more hands.Identifying lack of adequate health officials as a major challenge to containing the spread of the virus, he said, “Because of the fear of Ebola, everybody seems to be scared, nobody wants to assist, which is a major challenge.“It is even more so for the treatment isolation ward. It’s a major problem because a lot of people ran away, especially when the nurse died.”One of the senior medical practitioners in the hospital confided in one of our correspondents that his family members who currently reside abroad had been putting pressure on him to resign his appointment to prevent him from contracting the deadly virus.He also said that the doctors’ strike had been putting pressure on the available personnel to work more than the mandatory eight hours.He said, “The pressure is too much for us; we have been working for 24 hours instead of the statutory eight hours because of inadequate manpower as a result of the ongoing doctors’ strike and other health workers that have been reluctant to move near the patients.”Click image to read more.﻿Ebola: health workers scared, flee hospital | Glide Global TV Blogglideglobal.tv1Add a comment...
