One of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola, a government official said on Sunday, and a second US healthcare worker has been infected in what the World Health Organisation (WHO) is calling the largest outbreak ever recorded of the disease.Dr Samuel Brisbane is the first Liberian doctor to die in an outbreak, which the WHO says has killed 129 people in the west African nation. A Ugandan doctor working in the country died this month.Brisbane, who once served as a medical adviser to the former Liberian president, Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia.After falling ill, he was taken to a treatment centre on the outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister.Under the supervision of health workers, family members escorted the doctor's body to a burial location west of the city, Nyenswah said.He said another doctor who had been working in Liberia's central Bong County was being treated for Ebola at the centre where Brisbane died.The situation "is getting more and more scary," Nyenswah said.Last week Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor fell ill with the disease and in Liberia, Samaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, announced at the weekend that an American doctor was infected. Dr Kent Brantly had been isolated at the group's Ebola treatment centre at the ELWA hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.A second American, Nancy Writebol, later tested positive for the virus at the same medical compound, said Ken Isaacs, of Samaritan's Purse. Isaacs said Writebol, who works with the allied aid group SIM, was in a stable but serious condition at a hospital near Monrovia.Brantly received intensive treatment on Sunday and was talking to his medical team and working on his computer, said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for Samaritan's Purse."We are hopeful, but he is certainly not out of the woods yet," Strickland said.In Nigeria, officials announced on Friday that a Liberian official had died of Ebola after flying from Monrovia to Lagos raising fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa. The WHO says the outbreak has also killed 319 people in Guinea and 224 in Sierra Leone.Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, used her Independence Day address to discuss a new taskforce to combat Ebola. Information minister, Lewis Brown, said: "It will go from community to community, from village to village, from town to town in order to increase awareness."There is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever and sore throat but then escalates to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding.Experts believe the west African outbreak could have begun in January in south-east Guinea, though the first cases were not confirmed until March.Since then, officials have tried to contain the disease by isolating victims and educating populations on how to avoid transmission, though porous borders, satellite outbreaks and widespread distrust of health workers have made the outbreak difficult to bring under control.http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/j ... s-outbreak

Sawyer, who was in denial that his sister, Princess, was infected, told authorities at Catholic Hospital that she had a miscarriage; that is why she was hemorrhaging so much. It was Dr. Ruby, a Congolese who performed the D and C on Princess. After the procedure, the bleeding continued. This made the staff suspicious and tested her for Ebola.    Dr. Ruby is now quarantined and under observation at the hospital. Princess later died on July 7, and is highly suspected of infecting her brother, Patrick Sawyer. Princess, the girlfriend of Dr. Sam of Uganda, reportedly contracted the virus from her boyfriend because she was his caretaker during his time of illness. - See more at: http://nationalchronicleliberia.com/new ... lrCF4.dpufThe above comments link Patrick Sawyer to Dr Samuel Brisbane through his sister, Princess Sawyer.CORRECTION: Dr Sam is Dr. Sam Mutooro Muhumuza, a Ugandan national.http://allafrica.com/stories/201407281941.html

Kennedy Medical Center has become the latest casualty of the deadly Ebola virus.Dr. Brisbane, also a former Chief Medical Doctor at the Firestone Rubber Plantation Hospital had been quarantined along with a Physician Assistant and Doctor Nelson Korkor, the lead doctor at Phebe who was brought down to Monrovia three days ago after contracting the virus.Hospital sources say, Dr. Brisbane selected to treat himself at home initially in a bid not to spread the virus to others but was brought to the ELWA hospital where the Samaritan Group has been treating serious cases, when the illness worsened, until his death, Saturday.A hospital official told FrontPageAfrica Friday that Dr. Brisbane and the other ailing health workers were holding onto life, but that Dr. Brisbane vomited occasionally. The PA, however, is still said to be deteriorating, a senior hospital administrator told FrontPageAfrica on condition of anonymity. Dr. Brisbane's death comes just a day after the JFK's ER Wing was shut down and patients already in care moved to another floor in the hospital. Health care workers are bearing the brunt of the deadly outbreak.During programs marking the 167 Independence of Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf paid homage to the late Dr. Sam Mutooro Muhumuza, a Ugandan national, and all the health workers around the country who have made the ultimate sacrifice in saving lives. "To their families, loved ones, associates, we extend our heartfelt sympathy," she said, adding that the government will shortly reach out to the families of the departed health workers to bring them comfort in their times of trials and tribulations.http://allafrica.com/stories/201407281941.html

UFAhV.dpufEbola Claims Catholic Hospital’s Chief Admin (L): The late Dr./Bro. Patrick Nshamdze; (R) Plywood signs indicating those dumped in one mass grave in JohnsonvilleMon, 08/04/2014 - 11:30 admin Dumped with Others in Johnsonville Mass Grave By: Alaskai Moore Johnson, Observer Health Correspondent.The Daily Observer was told on Saturday, August 2, that the St. Joseph Catholic Hospital Chief Administrator, Bro/Dr. Patrick Nshamdze, has died, having contracted the deadly Ebola virus disease at least three weeks ago. He died Friday, August 1; he was 57.There were tears Saturday, August 2, at the Christ The King Catholic Church in Gaye Town when news filtered in that Bro Patrick has succumbed to the virus. He was very attached to the church and its members.Dr. Nshamdze, who preferred to be called “Bro. Patrick”, was from Cameroon and a member of the Catholic Community—Brothers of St. John of God. Bro. Patrick was one of the missionaries assigned at the St. Joseph Catholic Hospital in Congo Town. He was one of those very reliable medical practitioners, who kept the hospital intact and running.One Catholic source, who preferred to remain anonymous told the Observer that Bro Patrick had contracted the disease from a pregnant lady, who had been transferred from another health facility to the hospital. According to this source, the lady, who too, has died of the virus, came bleeding and it was Bro. Patrick, who had worked on her.“When Bro. Patrick was told that this lady had died from Ebola, he broke down, because he had had direct contact with her,” our source said.The Observer was told by other high-placed sources within the Catholic Church that the Church had requested his remains to be interred differently so that the Church and his relatives can one day pay homage to him but their plead was not granted as he was "dumped in a mass grave" containing at least 25 other victims, in Johnsonville, outside Monrovia.Very nearby the grave in which he and others were “dumped”, lay plywood billboards, indicating all of those buried in that mass grave.News filtered in late last night that Spain, which provides bulk of the hospital’s supports, was making plans to “evacuate” all the remaining missionary sisters and brothers assigned at the hospital.If this happens, it could be a deadly blow to the struggling health sector and nation at-large, grappling with the Ebola outbreak, which has claimed so many lives in Liberia. The St. Joseph Catholic Hospital is partially closed at the moment; this would be one last blow to finally close the hospital indefinitely.The Observer was told that the Catholic Church is expected to meet today to discuss these grave matters, including Bro. Patrick’s death.http://www.liberianobserver.com/news/eb ... hief-admin
