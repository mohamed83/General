Ebola: South African woman tested negative

The South African woman suspected of the Ebola Virus Disease has tested negative.
According to Minister of Health, Prof. Onyebuch Chukwu, the test conducted on the woman came back negative.
 She is however being investigated for other disease.
The South African woman, whose identity was not revealed, flew into the Murtala Muhammed International Airport from Morocco on Thursday.
She was treated as a suspected case and was being taken to Lagos’ Ebola treatment centre for tests to see whether she actually had the virus, Reuters reports.
The traveller, who lives in Cape Town, filled out a health questionnaire on her arrival at Lagos in which she acknowledged suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, both possible symptoms of the Ebola hemorrhagic virus.
“This person has been in Guinea and Sierra Leone since April and she has symptoms,” Dr. Morenike Alex-Okoh, director of Port Health Services at MMIA, told Reuters.
