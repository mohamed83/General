Two patients with suspected symptoms of the Ebola virus ran away from a rural health center in Al-Ais in the Madinah province on Sunday for fear of being arrested, a source at the center said.“The two African nationals, who did not have residency permits or any other documentation, came to see the doctor at the health center, complaining of difficulty breathing and bleeding while passing urine,” said the official, who requested anonymity.Medical officials were unable to conduct thorough examination since they ran away after being asked to produce their residency permits. The doctor on the case had also instructed the center to take the patients to a hospital with advanced facilities before the two took off.The matter was reported to police instantly, the source said.The police, who are currently hunting for illegal residents in the area, are also looking for the patients.The Health Affairs Directorate in Madinah said the patients were from East Africa, a region not affected by Ebola, although their precise nationality had not been identified.
