Alaska TV Reporter Quits on Air: ‘[Snip] It, I
Quit’ 
Charlo Greene, a reporter at CBS affiliate KTVA in Anchorage quit her job on air last night, telling viewers, “[Snip] it. I quit.” 

Greene was reporting on the Alaska Cannabis Club. Following the story, she revealed she is the owner of the medical marijuana business and was going
to be leaving TV news so she could devote her time to pushing for marijuana legalization in Alaska. 

At the end of the report, she stunned viewers, and the newscast anchor, with this: 
 

hahahaha, not quite the same but reminds me of the movie Network

Well... She definitely won't have to worry about getting another job on tv. NOBODY is going to take that risk. 

She left that one woman looking like a guppy out of water... She didn't know what to do. 

We've all been there before, haven't we?? How many times have you wanted to say that?? How many times have you actually said it? Yeah... Me either.

I imagine this video will go viral on YouTube. Imagine the publicity for KTVA, a channel I didn't even knew existed until now. Now everyone will have
heard of KTVA, KTVA will be famous...

for sharing.				      Vasa Croe    		posted on Sep, 22 2014 @ 09:03 AM				link     				That was brilliant!  LOL!				       Krazysh0t    +21 more 		posted on Sep, 22 2014 @ 09:04 AM				link     				a reply to: swanne 

KTVA-TV's response was: 
KTVA-TV’s news director later apologized for the incident on the station’s Facebook page, adding that Greene no longer worked at the
station. 

The funny part was that the director had to clarify that Greene no longer worked there. Well no crap... I think everyone watching the news broadcast
could figure that out. lol.

They can if it is live and they don't give a hoot. 
It made my morning as well everyone. Best part, the woman knows she more than likely is going to have a thriving business.

Well, you did watch an excerpt from their show. It's the video in the OP.  

Already 34,485 views on YouTube. Comments are all about her, her colleagues... suddenly everyone in this studio have a moment of pure fame.				      Krazysh0t    		posted on Sep, 22 2014 @ 09:28 AM				link      originally posted by: AllSourceIntel

Not likely. Live broadcasts are usually on a 5 - 10 second delay to prevent things like this.				      HomerinNC    		posted on Sep, 22 2014 @ 09:32 AM				link     				Lol that was too funny

Yes, usually, either it was not delayed or someone was sleeping at the controls.				      Krazysh0t    		posted on Sep, 22 2014 @ 09:38 AM				link     				a reply to: AllSourceIntel 

Well it is only a 5 to 10 second delay, maybe they were so surprised by one of their own dropping protocol that they weren't quick enough on the beep
button.				      MystikMushroom    		posted on Sep, 22 2014 @ 09:40 AM				link      The following is my opinion as a member participating in this discussion. This really didn't surprise any of us up here in Alaska that much. People up here generally speak their mind (see Sara Palin *sigh*). It was
kind of a shock, however, that she was involved at the level she was with the pro-MJ movement. She'll probably make more money with her other venture
than working at the TV station.  

The station she worked for was kind of considered the "B-team" or "ghetto" news station here anyway -- so again, no really to surprising." As an ATS Staff Member, I will not moderate in threads such as this where I have participated as a member.       jude11    		posted on Sep, 22 2014 @ 09:43 AM				link     				BEST...TV...MOMENT...EVER!!!!!

Ooo! Ooo! I've done it quite a few times in my life. It feels good.  

Of course I already had another job lined up.
