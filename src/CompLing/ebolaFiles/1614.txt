Two workers at the Nebraska Medical Center have been fired after looking at the file of Dr. Rick Sacra, who was infected with Ebola while working in Liberia. In a statement released Friday, the Center said that they "have a zero tolerance for unauthorized access to patient information" and that after an investigation the "two employees no longer work for the organization and other corrective action has been taken." http://goo.gl/x5jxb1

Will be really, really interesting to see if control systems were compromised.

As my old boss used to say. "Even the sun shine's on a dogs ass twice a day." Or something like that. Either way, there's still a lot of season left.

I'm sure this scam will be even more effective due all the fake news that there was a video of her to be released.
