Singapore: Nigerian Woman Suspected Of Ebola Cleared


 read 592 time(s)Straits Times 
The Nigerian woman who was sent from Gleneagles Hospital to the Communicable Diseases Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) on Thursday morning does not have Ebola as first feared. 
Professor Philip Choo, TTSH's chief executive officer, told The Straits Times that it was a false alarm and that she has since been discharged.
"We saw a patient with a history from Nigeria," he said, but her detailed history revealed "no contact with any suspect or confirmed patients."
Ebola is a highly-fatal viral disease that is spreading in West Africa, raising fears that it might spill over to the rest of the world.
The woman in her 50s was identified as a possible Ebola case by doctors in Gleneagles Hospital on Thursday morning.
She is believed to have flown into Singapore recently and arrived at the hospital's emergency department with a fever. She was immediately isolated and transferred by ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
