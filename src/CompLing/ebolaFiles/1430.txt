HEUS President Barack Obama has assured leaders of Sierra Leone and Liberia of his support in the fight against Ebola.Phone calls to Presidents Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone came as the US State Department ordered families of its diplomats in Sierra Leone to leave the country to avoid exposure to the disease.EXPRESSED CONDOLENCE“In his conversations with both leaders, the President underscored the commitment of the United States to work with Liberia, Sierra Leone, and other international partners to contain the outbreak and expressed his condolences for the lives lost,” the White House said.The leaders also discussed the presence of agents of the US Centers for Disease Control and the Disaster Assistance Response Team on the ground.The move comes two days after President Koroma chastised the West for "responding slowly" to his request for help in containing the epidemic.LACK OF OPTIONSIn announcing the departure of families of US Embassy staff in Sierra Leone on August 7, the State Department said it was acting “out of an abundance of caution.”State Department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf cited “a lack of options for routine health-care services at major medical facilities due to the Ebola outbreak.”As of Wednesday, according to the World Health Organisation, 1,069 people had died of the disease since the start of the year when it spread from Guinea to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the last and most populous West African country to be affected.Both Presidents Koroma and Johnson Sireaf were forced to cancel their trips to the US-Africa leaders summit to address the situation.
