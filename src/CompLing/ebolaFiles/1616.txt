Suspected Ebola patient in Chuv quarantine (update)

LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND – Update 16:00 – Federal health authorities say initial tests have come up negative, but a battery of tests will be run again and the young Guinean suspected of having Ebola will remain hospitalized.
A 23-year-old Guinea man is in quarantine at the Chuv university hospitals in Lausanne, where he was taken when he developed a fever, after being hospitalized for a week, considered to be at risk for Ebola, but without symptoms.
Swiss federal health authorities, who are running tests to see if he has Ebola, say there is  no risk to others in Switzerland because the disease is contagious only once symptoms show.
The youth arrived in Switzerland 17 September and went to the centre for asylum seekers in Vallorbe, but was taken directly to a hospital to be watched because he told a relative he had a family member who died of Ebola and he had arrived in France two days earlier from Guinea, free of symptoms.
His fever developed 23 September and, based on criteria and the action plan set by the Federal Health Office, he was hospitalized and tests run. The results will be published once they are available, says Bern.
History of a disease that smoldered points to weak health care systems
Some 3,000 people have died of the disease in West Africa since the current outbreak in December 2013. It’s been traced to an area in Guinea near the borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva 22 September noted that “This outbreak has since evolved into the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak in the history of the disease.”
Series of WHO essays on various aspects of Ebola, “Six months after the Ebola outbreak was declared: What happens when a deadly virus hits the destitute?”
Ebola led to 8 murders near Liberia border
Le Temps today carries a report on eight people who were murdered 17 September in Womé, a town in Guinea near the border with Liberia. The humanitarian aid group, which included a pastor and three journalists, was in the region to provide health education about Ebola, but they were accused of being part of  plot by the government to reduce the number of forest-dwellers. The outbreak of the disease was in heavily forested area in this region.
