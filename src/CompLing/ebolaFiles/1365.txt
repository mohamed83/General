40 minutes agoEbola survivor: No time to waste as Obama ups aidEbola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, former Medical Director of Samaritan's Purse Ebola Care Center in Monrovia, Liberia, shakes hands with Emira Woods, Director of Social Impact at ThoughtWorks, before the start of a Senate committee hearing on Ebola on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2014. Looking on at left is Brantly's wife Amber.SUSAN WALSH/APBy Lauran Neergaard and Jim Kuhnhenn The Associated PressPublished: September 17, 2014 In this April 2013 photo, U.S. Army Maj.

Jay Ostrich/U.S. Air ForceUS troops dispatched to fight Ebola will find an epidemic out of control, UN saysThe World Health Organization expects tens of thousands of people will be infected with Ebola before the current epidemic is contained, and it called for nations to commit far more resources to combating the outbreak.The latest patient was flown from Africa to a military air base just outside Atlanta, then taken in ambulances with police escorts to Emory University Hospital's special isolation unit. This 1995 transmission electron micrograph (TEM) shows some of the changes in this tissue sample isolate brought on due to an Ebola hemorrhagic fever infection, including the presence of numbers of Ebola virions. Courtesy of the CDCUS, Britain to send troops to help fight Ebola in West AfricaThe United States and Britain are sending troops and equipment to West Africa to help curb the spread of Ebola, officials said Monday, as the World Health Organization warned that the outbreak is outstripping the capacity to respond in one of the worst-hit countries.Army scientists: Ebola outbreak larger than official numbersResearchers from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, who have worked in Sierra Leone and Liberia, say the current outbreak reaches beyond the 1,200 confirmed, suspected or probable cases.President Barack Obama said Sunday that the U.S. military will begin aiding what has been a chaotic and ineffective response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, arguing that it represents a serious national security concern.Ebola is surging in places it had been beaten backThe Macenta region, right on the Liberian border, had been one of the first places where the outbreak surfaced, but they hadn't seen a new case for weeks. So they packed up, leaving a handful of staff on stand-by. The outbreak was showing signs of slowing elsewhere as well. Instead, new cases appeared across the border in Liberia and then spread across West Africa, carried by the sick and dying. Now, months later, Macenta is once again a hotspot.WASHINGTON  — An American doctor who survived Ebola said there's no time to waste as President Barack Obama outlined his plan to ramp up the U.S. response to the epidemic in West Africa."We can't afford to wait months, or even weeks, to take action, to put people on the ground," Dr. Kent Brantly told senators Tuesday.Obama called the Ebola crisis a threat to world security as he ordered up to 3,000 U.S. military personnel to the region along with an aggressive effort to train health care workers and deliver field hospitals. Under the plan, the government could end up devoting $1 billion to containing the disease."If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people affected, with profound economic, political and security implications for all of us," Obama said after briefings in Atlanta with doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from Emory University, where Brantly and two other aid workers with Ebola have been treated.Obama acted under pressure from regional leaders and international aid organizations who pleaded for a heightened U.S. role in confronting the deadly virus. He called on other countries to also quickly supply more health workers, equipment and money."It's a potential threat to global security if these countries break down," Obama said, speaking of the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. At least 2,400 people have died, with Liberia bearing the brunt.He described the task ahead as "daunting" but said what gives him hope is that "the world knows how to fight this disease."Topping the new aid, the U.S. promises to deliver 17 100-bed treatment centers to Liberia, where contagious patients often sit in the streets, turned away from packed Ebola units. The Pentagon expects to have the first treatment units open within a few weeks, part of a heightened U.S. response that includes training more local health care workers."This massive ramp-up of support from the United States is precisely the kind of transformational change we need to get a grip on the outbreak and begin to turn it around," said World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan.Doctors Without Borders, which has sounded the alarm for months, also welcomed the U.S. scale-up but said that it needed to be put into action immediately — and that other countries must follow suit."The response to Ebola continues to fall dangerously behind and too many lives are being lost," said Brice de le Vingne, the group's director of operations. "We need more countries to stand up, we need greater concrete action on the ground, and we need it now."Nearly 5,000 people have become ill from Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal since it was first recognized in March. WHO says it anticipates that figure could rise to more than 20,000 and end up costing nearly $1 billion to contain.The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Thursday on the crisis, and the head of the United Nations said the General Assembly will follow up with a high-level meeting next week as the world body "is taking the lead now" on the international fight.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed Obama's plan, his spokesman said in a statement, and called on the international community "to be as bold and courageous in its response as those who are on the front lines fighting this disease."At a packed Senate hearing, the CDC's Dr. Beth Bell told senators the outbreak is "ferocious and spreading exponentially.""If we do not act now to stop Ebola, we could be dealing with it for years to come," she warned.Congress still must vote on an Obama administration request for $88 million more to help the Ebola fight, including funding CDC work in West Africa through December and speeding development of experimental treatments and vaccines.The U.S. already has spent more than $100 million fighting the outbreak. Obama administration officials said some of the costs of the new military response would be covered by $500 million in overseas contingency operations, such as the war in Afghanistan, that the Pentagon already has asked Congress to redirect for West Africa and for humanitarian assistance in Iraq. Late Tuesday, the Obama administration submitted a request to reprogram another $500 million in Pentagon money for the Ebola effort.Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said urgent action was needed. "We must take the dangerous, deadly threat of the Ebola epidemic as seriously as we take ISIS," he said, referring to the extremist group in Syria and Iraq.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the 3,000 troops would not provide direct care to Ebola patients. In addition to delivering the 17 treatment facilities, they will help train as many as 500 local health care workers a week. Among other initiatives the military will:Set up a headquarters in Monrovia, Liberia, led by Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, head of U.S. Army Africa.Build a regional transportation and staging base in Senegal, where the U.S. will help coordinate the contributions of other allies and partners.Provide home health care kits to hundreds of thousands of households, designed to help healthy people caring for Ebola-stricken family members. That includes 50,000 kits the U.S. Agency for International Development will deliver to Liberia this week.Carrying out a home- and community-based campaign to train local populations on how to handle exposed patients.In Monrovia, Boima Folley runs a sport materials shop and said he'd welcome the U.S. military response."We have been praying to get the disease wiped out of our country, so if the coming of U.S. troops will help us get that done, we should be happy," he said."The soldiers don't have to have medical backgrounds. They can help with logistics," he added.AP writers Lolita Baldor and Jennifer C. Kerr in Washington and Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia contributed to this report.http://www.stripes.com/news/us/ebola-su ... d-1.303469

Ebola epidemic 'spiraling out of control', Obama warnsLatest update : 2014-09-17President Barack Obama issued a global call to action to combat the Ebola crisis in West Africa on Tuesday, warning that the epidemic was "spiraling out of control" and could have "profound political, economic and security implications" for us all."Here's the hard truth. In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before," Obama said."It's spiraling out of control. It is getting worse. It's spreading faster and exponentially," he said. "Today, thousands of people in West Africa are infected. That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands."Speaking as he announced that 3,000 US military personnel would be deployed to West Africa to help local health authorities deal with the crisis, Obama stressed that the outbreak poses a threat to global political and economic stability as well as to security."If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us."UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon concurred that the outbreak has far-reaching implications. "This has gone beyond health issues," Ban said on Monday."It has gone to areas affecting social and economic situations. It may even affect political stability if not properly contained and treated."The epidemic has killed more than 2,400 people in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone so far this year and has also been reported in Senegal.The outbreak is on track to infect 20,000 people by the end of the year.'Almost $1 billion needed'The United Nations said an effective response to the crisis would require $987.8 million (€763 million), with about half of that needed for the worst-hit nation of Liberia.The US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, called Monday for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday, warning that the risk of the virus could “set the countries of West Africa back a generation”.The US plans to set up a command and control center in Liberia's capital Monrovia as well as build new treatment centres and train health workers.Officials have said it would take about two weeks to get the US forces on the ground.The Department of Defense plans to ask Wednesday for "an additional $500 million in Fiscal Year 2014 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to fight Ebola", an administration official said.The OCO funds would be in addition to $175 million already dedicated to battling the outbreak and another $88 million requested earlier through a continuing resolution.The disease is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of sick patients, making doctors and nurses especially vulnerable to contracting the virus, which has no vaccine or cure aside from some promising experimental treatments.Ebola can fell its victims within days, causing severe fever and muscle pain, weakness, vomiting and diarrhea – in some cases shutting down organs and causing unstoppable bleeding.'Lethally inadequate' responseThe UN has said if the international community and affected countries respond swiftly and energetically, transmission should begin to slow by the end of the year and halt by mid-2015. But the level of response that would be required to halt its spread is unparalleled."The level of surge we need to do is unprecedented. It is massive," the United Nations' Ebola coordinator, David Nabarro, told reporters.The world body has set a goal of stopping the spread of Ebola within six to nine months, but aid agencies are complaining that help has been too slow.The EU, Britain, France and Cuba have pledged to send medical personnel and other aid to the region. China will send a mobile team to Sierra Leone, including epidemiologists, clinicians and nurses – bringing the number of Chinese medics in the country to 174, the World Health Organization said.But this is far from enough, warned Joanne Liu, head of the Doctors Without Borders (Médécins sans frontières) charity.Noting that the known Ebola toll "represents only a fraction of the real number", she stressed that "the ground response remains totally and lethally inadequate"."The window of opportunity to contain this outbreak is closing," she said.The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to adopt a resolution on Thursday exhorting countries to provide urgent aid to the crisis-stricken region.UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told reporters in Geneva the Ebola crisis faced a "huge funding challenge". The capacity of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to provide even the most basic necessities is "on the brink of collapse", she warned.The World Bank has approved a $105 million grant, part of a $200 million pledge made in early August aimed at helping people cope with the economic impact of the crisis and strengthening public health systems."The world needs to do much, much more to respond to the Ebola crisis in these three countries," World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement.(FRANCE 24 with AFP)http://www.france24.com/en/20140917-oba ... ic-africa/

U.S. Troops To Help With Ebola Outbreak; Unclear Who Will Be AssignedPosted: Wed 6:11 AM, Sep 17, 2014By: Kristin Haubrich/KKTV The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is rapidly escalating into a crisis.  President Obama announced this week that about 3,000 U.S. troops will be sent to the affected region. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is rapidly escalating into a crisis.President Obama announced this week that about 3,000 U.S. troops will be sent to the affected region. 11 News spoke to the Department of Defense Tuesday to find out if the president's decision will impact southern Colorado. At this point, the DoD is uncertain.The DoD is still trying to figure out all of the requirements needed for those who do go, and have not determined where these 3,000 troops will come from.According to the president, the Ebola epidemic has enormous ramifications that go far beyond the borders of the countries it presently remains contained to. His press secretary says Obama is concerned that the outbreak could contribute to political instability in the region, and considers fighting the outbreak "a top national security priority." The president is also concerned that if left unchecked, the virus could transform and become more contagious."We know that if we take the proper steps we can save lives," Obama said Tuesday. "But we have to act fast."The World Health Organization has warned that the number of Ebola cases in West Africa could start doubling every three weeks.Under the president's $750 million plan, the 3,000 U.S. troops deployed to the region would assist with medical and logistical support--but not have direct contact with patients.Other initiatives include (Courtesy of CBS)-- Train as many as 500 health care workers each week.-- Erect 17 heath care facilities in the region each with 100 beds.-- Set up a joint command headquartered in Monrovia, Liberia, to coordinate between U.S. and international relief efforts.-- Provide home health care kits to hundreds of thousands of households, including 50,000 that the U.S. Agency for International Development will deliver to Liberia this week.-- Carry out a home- and community-based campaign to train local populations on how to handle exposed patients.A political science professor at Colorado College--and a recognized expert on Ebola--told 11 News the president's plan could be effective."If that's the role that our troops are put into, I think it could be highly effective, certainly more effective than the current strategies, which are not working," Andrew Price-Smith said.At present, nearly 5,000 people have contracted Ebola, and at least 2,400 have died.http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/US-T ... 20821.html

United States commits troops and cash to Ebola fightObama pledges 3,000 personnel and roughly $750 million to stem outbreak in West Africa.Sara Reardon16 September 2014Pablo Martinez Monsivais/APUS President Barack Obama says the world must act quickly to stem the Ebola outbreak. The world must act quickly to contain West Africa's Ebola outbreak, which is “spiralling out of control”, US President Barack Obama said on 16 September.Blue whales rebound in the PacificFew genes found linked to IQBenefactors to support CO2 monitoringTo that end, the United States will send 3,000 military personnel and spend roughly US$750 million on fighting the epidemic, which is thought to have infected nearly 5,000 people and has killed more than 2,400, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. Experts say that a massive increase in personnel and other resources will be necessary to contain the virus.“The world knows how to fight this disease,” Obama said during a visit to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. “We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. But we have to act fast. We can't dawdle on this one.”Biodefence experts see the deployment of military personnel as a turning point in the effort to halt Ebola’s spread. “When they take over an operation, you can be assured things are going to go according to a set plan,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania.The US effort will be based in Monrovia: Liberia is the country that has been hardest hit by the epidemic. It will set up 17 new hospitals in affected areas, coordinate transportation of equipment and personnel and set up a centre to train 500 health-care workers per week, according to the White House.Unusual responseThe US military often responds to natural disasters, such as floods or earthquakes, in other countries, but this is the first massive deployment for an outbreak, says Lawrence Gostin, an expert in public-health law at Georgetown University in Washington DC. The response is long overdue, he says, and the military could “bring discipline to the very chaotic response that’s been occurring on the ground where nobody’s taken the lead”.On 28 August, the WHO estimated that it would cost $490 million and require nearly 13,000 more health-care workers to end the epidemic — but it has not been clear who would provide these resources, in part because the WHO recently slashed its budget for rapid responses to outbreaks. Donations have been trickling in from governments and private charities such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington; on 8 September, for instance, the United Kingdom announced that it would deploy military forces and build a hospital with 62 beds in Sierra Leone. And on 12 September, Cuba said it would send 165 health-care workers to Africa.Related storiesBlood transfusion named as priority treatment for EbolaEbola virus mutating rapidly as it spreadsCost to control Ebola shoots upMore related storiesThe US effort was announced just as the World Bank approved the release of $105 million from the $230 million that it has committed to support both the immediate response to Ebola and the long-term rebuilding of affected countries’ ravaged health systems.The United States has spent more than $100 million on the Ebola response so far, the White House says — including $10 million to send more than 100 health-care workers to the region. The defence department hopes to redirect $500 million allocated for other programmes to the Ebola fight. And Obama has requested another $88 million from Congress for the effort, including $30 million to send additional CDC personnel to Africa. Already, more than 100 agency staff are in outbreak areas, making this the CDC’s largest international deployment in response to a health crisis.Looking aheadIt remains to be seen, however, whether this response will help prevent future outbreaks. “My greatest fear is this will be another Haiti,” Gostin says, referring to the 2010 earthquake and concurrent cholera outbreak there, to which the US military responded. “All of a sudden we throw a lot of resources at it and then leave. Then the next epidemic happens down the road.”At least some resources are being used for this purpose during the current outbreak. The European Union’s €140-million (US$181-million) donation is aimed largely at long-term rebuilding of health-care systems in areas where Ebola has spread, for instance.But not everyone agrees that efforts to improve basic health-care capacity should be a priority. Leaders from the international aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières say that such a focus could detract from efforts to aid the sick and the dying. “The prevailing trend to treat humanitarian assistance as a branch of development aid might contribute to the current hands-off approach, leading to a paralysis of effective and direct humanitarian aid on the ground,” they wrote in a 10 September correspondence to the Lancet1.But workers and troops deployed to fight Ebola will have a difficult task because of a general distrust of governments and foreign workers, which has helped to contribute to the disease's spread. “Any military response is going to have to be very respectful and patient with that trust deficit,” Gostin says.Nature doi:10.1038/nature.2014.15946ReferencesPhilips, M. & Markham, Á. Lancet http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61606-8 (2014).http://www.nature.com/news/united-state ... ht-1.15946

French MSF Medical Worker Contracts EbolaPeople read newspaper headlines commenting on U.S. President Barack Obama's announcement on sending troops to fight the Ebola virus in Monrovia, Liberia, Sept. 17, 2014. Last updated on: September 17, 2014 6:45 PMA French staff member of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has contracted the Ebola virus while working in Liberia.The humanitarian relief organization announced in a press release Wednesday that the woman, who was on assignment in Monrovia, was placed in isolation on Tuesday after developing a fever. She will be taken to France for treatment.MSF has more than 2,000 workers in West Africa responding to the Ebola crisis, including 200 foreign international staffers.The woman is the most recent case of foreign health care workers who have become ill while treating Ebola patients in West Africa.U.S. Troops to Liberia At the request of the Liberian government, U.S. President Barack Obama said this week that 3,000 U.S. troops would deploy to West Africa to coordinate the medical and humanitarian response to Ebola.The U.S. soldiers will be based in Monrovia and tasked with training medical workers, managing supplies and building new treatment facilities.U.S. Initiatives to Fight EbolaAssign 3,000 U.S. forces to Monrovia, Liberia, to provide command and control support in the region, facilitate coordination of U.S. and international relief efforts.Train as many as 500 health care workers a week.Build 17 heath care facilities in the region of 100 beds each.Provide home health care kits to 400,000 households, including 50,000 that the U.S. Agency for International Development will deliver to Liberia this week.Carry out a home- and community-based campaign to train local populations on how to handle exposed patients.Sources: White House, APObama said the U.S. military is in the best position to expedite the international response. "We're prepared to take leadership on this to provide the kinds of capabilities that only America has, and to mobilize the world in a way that only America can do," he said. "This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security, it's a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic," Obama said. "That has profound effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the disease.""Significant moment" for LiberiaLiberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Wednesday called the decision to "significant moment" in the battle against the worst Ebola outbreak on record.  She said she hoped the U.S. decision would spur other nations into action.In a message to the Liberian people, Johnson Sirleaf said on Wednesday her government was "fighting back'' against the deadly virus. Ebola has killed around 1,300 people in Liberia, the country hardest hit by the outbreak."Our American partners realize Liberia cannot defeat Ebola alone. This disease is not simply a Liberian or West African problem. The entire community of nations has a stake in ending this crisis,'' Johnson Sirleaf said in a written statement.U.N. to take the leadEarlier this week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he and World Health Organization Director General Margaret Chan will outline an international plan to combat the Ebola virus on Thursday, during an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.The council is due to vote the same day on a U.S.-drafted resolution calling on member states to quickly send aid, field hospitals and health workers to affected countries and lift travel restrictions to those areas.Ban said the U.N. General Assembly will also hold a "high-level meeting" on the situation next week.  He called the Ebola outbreak "an exponential crisis that demands an exceptional global response.""Every day we delay, the cost and suffering will grow exponentially.  We cannot allow bans on travel or transport to slow us down," Ban said. "We need isolation of people affected by Ebola -- not of nations struggling to cope with it."The most recent outbreak has killed nearly 2,500 people - a conservative estimate that health experts say could be two to three times as high, given unreported cases.The outbreak of the highly contagious virus, which causes fever and uncontrolled bleeding, was first confirmed in the remote forests of southeastern Guinea in March, then spread across Sierra Leone and Liberia.A handful of Ebola deaths have been recorded in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. Economic funding The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday that it would give $127 million in interest-free loans to the three countries most affected by the virus - Guinea $40 million, Liberia $48 million and Sierra Leone $39 million.A day earlier, the World Bank approved a $105 million grant for the Ebola response.The United Nations estimates it will need $1 billion to combat the deadly disease in the coming six months.http://www.voanews.com/content/voa-libe ... 52829.html

Ebola outbreak: Why the U.S. is taking the lead"We have to act fast," Obama warnsBy Daniel Schwartz, CBC News Posted: Sep 17, 2014 5:00 AM ET Last Updated: Sep 17, 2014 7:56 PM ETU.S. President Barack Obama warned in a speech Tuesday in Atlanta, "We have to act fast" to deal with the Ebola virus ravaging West Africa. Earlier, the White House unveiled plans for the Obama government to take the lead in efforts to end the epidemic.While Obama labelled Ebola a national security priority, dealing with an epidemic in Africa wouldn't normally be a campaign that the U.S. government would lead.Obama called it "an epidemic of the likes we have not seen before." Nevertheless, it should be the governments in the countries affected taking the lead, notes Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.But Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are extremely poor, post-conflict nations with other issues and problems, he adds. They were also caught off guard when the outbreak began, as this is the first outbreak in West Africa and Michaud says they had no plan in place and no materials ready to go."They haven't been able to mount the response necessary as the number of cases has grown."In Liberia, which has a population of just over four million, there was one doctor for every 100,000 people before the outbreak. By Sept. 15, Ebola had killed 85 health-care workers in Liberia.Early warning, late responseDoctors Without Borders, which has about 1,850 staff on the ground in West Africa, began to sound the alarm about Ebola getting out of control in April.Obama EbolaPresident Barack Obama announced he is sending 3,000 American military personnel to West Africa nations to fight the the Ebola epidemic, while speaking at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Sept. 16. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press)They called on the UN's World Health Organization to lead the global effort against Ebola. The WHO wouldn't declare the Ebola outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern" until early August.Michaud notes, "WHO has been labouring under some difficulties of its own." Their two-year budget had been cut by almost $1 billion and key staff with expertise on emergency response had left as priorities shifted away from potential threats like Ebola.WHO's epidemic and pandemic response department was dissolved and the outbreak and emergency response section at WHO's Geneva headquarters looked like a ghost town, a WHO consultant told the New York Times.WHO cut almost all its emergency outbreak experts in Africa to just three before the current Ebola outbreak."All of us underestimated this unprecedented, unusual outbreak," WHO director general Margaret Chan told the Times.U.S. has the capacityIn the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a budget three times the size of the WHO budget. And while WHO has about 170 foreign medical staff working on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the CDC alone has over 100 personnel on the ground in West Africa, with many more from other government agencies and more to come as the U.S. ramps up its efforts.Last week, Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, sent a personal plea to Obama, writing, "Without more direct help from your government, we will lose this battle against Ebola." She noted that only Doctors Without Borders had "responded robustly" in Liberia and they had reached their limits.While the U.S. government will now take the lead in the Ebola battle, Obama asked the military to coordinate that effort."The U.S. military is really the only organization, perhaps in the entire world, that could provide the support and the resources at the pace necessary to fully respond to the growing outbreak of Ebola," Michaud says.He also teaches at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and is considered an authority on the role of the U.S. Department of Defense in global health.After pointing out that the chances of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. "are extremely low," Obama said the outbreak is not just a medical emergency faraway in Africa but a crisis with political, economic and security implications if the epidemic is not stopped soon.While warning the epidemic will get worse before it gets better, he characterized it as "a potential threat to global security."Turning the tide?Josh MichaudU.S. global health expert Josh Michaud says 'this is a moment when the tables could be turned on Ebola.' (Kaiser Family Foundation)"There seems to be agreement on all sides that more needs to be done," Michaud told CBC News after following the debates at two congressional hearings Tuesday in Washington."He says, "This is a moment when the tables could be turned on Ebola." And not solely because of the U.S. effort.In the past week, Canada, China, Cuba, France and the U.K. were among the countries announcing additional commitments to West Africa, as did foundations and charitable organizations, including $50 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, its largest donation to a single outbreak."If all of these resources are mustered and 3,000 troops are sent out there, and if ... all of the various constellations of organizations that are helping respond also are catalyzed to do more, then this could be the point where the global community really does take this head-on and turns the tide," Michaud says.http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-out ... ign=buffer

PerspectiveHISTORY OF MEDICINEEbola in a Stew of FearGregg Mitman, Ph.D.September 17, 2014DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp1411244“Bush meat?” I asked. The food in front of me smelled delicious, but the mention of bush meat in the stew evoked a twinge of fear. Could it be fruit bat? Chimpanzee? Both can harbor Ebola virus.Our four-member team had just filmed a documentary in a remote rural village near the Guinea border. Shaded by the thatched roof of an open-air rice kitchen, we were sitting down to share a communal meal. Awaiting us was a tempting Liberian stew of cassava, pepper — and bush meat.My hosts smiled. Even here, an hour's trek from the nearest road, and a 2-day drive from the capital city of Monrovia, news of the Ebola outbreak hung in the air. “Don't worry,” they assured me. No fruit bat. No chimpanzee. I hesitated a moment longer, but I didn't want to seem mistrustful. So I dipped my spoon into the pot and savored the spicy flavors.The journey to Liberia in June had been uncertain. The international media had been mostly quiet about the slow burn of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone in early March, when I began planning the trip. But I soon started following reports of Ebola cases through personal contacts and Liberian news sources. In late May, as I was preparing to leave, information in the Western press and on government websites was still spotty.In late July, when word came that two American health care workers in Liberia had become infected, the outbreak suddenly drew global headlines labeling it an “epidemic.” Ignited by media attention, fear erupted and spread faster than the virus itself. Quarantine is now the watchword. Fear of Ebola escaping the African continent has finally brought international attention.Some aspects of Ebola's ecology are known. Bats appear to be reservoirs for the virus, although other animals are susceptible and can pass the infection to humans.But the fear surrounding the virus has its own ecology that needs to be understood as well. What writer Mike Davis calls “the ecology of fear” is different in the country than in the city. It varies with cultural traditions and religious beliefs. Rich people experience it differently from poor people. And it changes over time. Western attitudes associating equatorial Africa with deadly diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, and Ebola abound. And the fear displayed toward doctors and nurses in affected areas is more than the product of ignorance and superstition. Such fears also reflect the scars and painful memories of past medical encounters in West Africa.This is not the first time a disease outbreak has made West Africa the subject of global attention and concern. Over the course of 1928 and 1929, for instance, a flare-up of yellow fever in West Africa resulted in the deaths of prominent American, British, and Japanese medical researchers and educational advisers. It prompted the U.S. government and the League of Nations to put intense political pressure on the Liberian government to address the “unsanitary conditions” deemed a “menace” to “the lives of . . . the citizens and subjects of foreign nations who reside in Liberia.”1Fears of West Africa as the white man's grave, a view dating back to the 18th century, persisted in early 20th-century accounts of the yellow fever scourge. These fears survive to this day. They lay behind my nervous question on the Guinea border. They appear, more blatantly, in Donald Trump's much-publicized tweet: “stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will . . . spread inside our `borders.'”But the ecology of fear has other historical expressions. The yellow fever outbreak signified a major threat to American business in Liberia. In 1926, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company gained access to 1 million acres of land to supply the United States with rubber free from British control. Knowledge of tropical medicine was vital to the company's success.It was, in fact, a 1926 Harvard medical expedition to Liberia, undertaken on behalf of Firestone, that had brought my film team to the Liberia–Guinea border in 2014. We hoped to learn more about the history and memory of local encounters with the expedition. In 1926, the eight-member team had traveled for 4 months through the Liberian interior, collecting blood, tumors, urine, and photographs of diverse ethnic groups. Some people ran away when they saw these strangers. The routes the expedition traveled were those used by European and West African slave traders, white missionaries, and Liberian soldiers recently sent to conquer the interior. Why stick around when strangers had been such potent contributors to the local ecology of fear?Other Liberians resisted the expedition's efforts to extract their tumors, blood, and parasites. When a town chief refused to give up his “charming little tumor,” wrote an expedition member, “we cajoled, we threatened, we vowed he would die . . . and still he coyly refused to part with that most . . . cherished treasure.”2 The chief had grounds for suspicion: the taking of bodily things, and the administering of experimental drugs, probably seemed all too close to the witchcraft he had good reason to fear.American medical research profited from the blood, parasites, and viruses collected on these expeditions. Such materials were the stuff of Nobel Prizes, professional prestige and fame, and medical breakthroughs that benefited people throughout the world. The 1951 Nobel Prize awarded to Max Theiler, a member of the 1926 Harvard expedition, for his work on a yellow fever vaccine, is one example. But biomedical research did little in return to help build medical knowledge and public health capacity within Liberia. When Liberian friends now post on Facebook links connecting the Ebola outbreak to past American biomedical research, they point to the history and memory of exploitation and extraction that run deep in West Africa. These roots of medical extraction in Africa contribute to the ecology of fear.A decade of peace has passed in Liberia, following 14 years of a civil war that racked the nation between 1989 and 2003. The country's infrastructure is slowly being rebuilt. A new wave of land concessions have been granted to multinational corporations seeking to extract Liberia's mineral and agricultural wealth. Yet investment in the country's medical infrastructure languishes. Liberia has fewer than 200 doctors for a population of 4 million. It is poorly equipped to deal with the current public health crisis. Remembering this history can help us understand why the current Ebola epidemic — and the ecology of fear associated with it — is unfolding as it is.My dinner hosts on the Liberia–Guinea border knew of Ebola and its risks long before the disease made Western headlines. They were not ignorant. Their fears, like my own, were grounded in past experiences and present circumstances.But we shared more than fear. We also shared a common history, one that has bound the United States and Liberia since free blacks from America first settled on West African shores in the 1820s.And the laughter we shared that day, when a fearful white American asked the question, “Bush meat?” spoke to a recognition not of difference but of a shared humanity.In this moment of crisis, fears arising from difference and ignorance of the historical and cultural contexts that underlie mistrust create a toxic ecology in which the Ebola virus thrives and spreads.As of mid-September, total international pledges for Ebola aid amount to approximately $338 million.3 Personnel from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are now on the ground in Liberia. But international aid workers will need to engage many people in local communities to win this fight against Ebola. Unless aid workers and the media understand local fears, we may fail to stem the crisis, which is devastating the economy, health, and well-being of a nation with deep historical ties to the United States.Modern medicine owes a debt to West Africans for past sacrifices made in the advancement of global health. This week's announcement by President Barack Obama of a U.S. commitment to build 17 Ebola treatment centers in Liberia, train medical workers, provide testing kits, and offer logistic support is a welcome and needed response. It should be the start of a long-term, concerted effort to strengthen the public health infrastructure, which is critical to the region's future stability.Disclosure forms provided by the author are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.This article was published on September 17, 2014, at NEJM.org.SOURCE INFORMATIONFrom the Departments of Medical History and Bioethics, History of Science, and History, and the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies, University of Wisconsin–Madison.http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1411244

US Congress approves stopgap funding bill18 Sep 2014 | 23:37 BST | Posted by Lauren Morello | Category: Uncategorized8531546523_b9f1ac7440_zThe US Congress may consider approving a final 2015 budget in November.The US Senate passed a stopgap spending bill on 18 September that includes US$88 million to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.The bill, endorsed by the House of Representatives on 17 September, now heads to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign it into law. The legislation would fund government operations from 1 October — when the 2015 fiscal year begins — until 11 December.Under the plan, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would receive $30 million to send additional health workers and resources to countries affected by the Ebola outbreak; the agency said earlier this week that it has roughly 100 personnel in Africa working on Ebola response. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would receive $58 million to fund the development of the promising antibody cocktail known as ZMapp, made by Mapp Pharmaceutical in San Diego, California, and two vaccines against Ebola produced by the US National Institutes of Health and NewLink Genetics of Ames, Iowa.The funding is a small fraction of the 3,000 military personnel and roughly $750 million that Obama has committed to the Ebola fight. The disease is thought to have infected more than 5,300 people and has killed more than 2,600, according to the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.The temporary funding measure would essentially hold US agencies’ budgets flat at 2014 levels. A more permanent 2015 spending plan will have to wait until Congress returns to work after the federal election on 4 November.Below are the funding levels that key US science agencies received in 2014, plus the funding levels proposed in 2015 House and Senate spending bills, and the estimated fiscal 2015 funding included in the stopgap measure approved on 18 September (all figures in US$ millions).Agency	2014 funding level	2015 House proposal	2015 Senate proposal	2015 stopgap measure (estimated)National Institutes of Health	30,003	N/A	N/A	30,003Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	5,882	N/A	N/A	5,912Food and Drug Administration	2,640*	2,574	2,588	2,640National Science Foundation	7,172	7,404	7,255	7,172NASA (science)	5,151	5,193	5,200	5,151Department of Energy Office of Science	5,066	5,071	N/A	5,066Environmental Protection Agency	8,200	7,483	N/A	8,200National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration	5,314	5,325	5,420	5,314US Geological Survey	1,032	1,035	N/A	1,032* Includes one-time transfer of $79 million in user fees.Additional reporting by Sara Reardon. http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/09/us ...
