Who Created Ebola? The Usual Suspects…

You can still get the Nano Silver you need here:

You don’t need a bucket of ice over your head to stop Ebola!
.

Dr. Rima’s Comments at Liberian Obsserver.com
.
Consider this before you dismiss Dr. Broderick’s article: “Ebola, AIDS Manufactured By Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?”*.
.
First, some background:
.
1. FDA (US) says there is no approved drug treatment for Ebola.  That is true because FDA lacks the authority to approve a nutrient and the only drugs can provide “treatment”.  Nano Silver 10 PPM is a NUTRIENT and, as such, cannot be approved under US law: it is permitted by virtue of being a nutrient.  Further, under US law, it can not be said to be a treatment, but can be said to be a therapy.  Therefore, using intentionally deceptive language, the false implication is created by the US government that there is nothing effective to prevent or treat Ebola.  Both are blatantly untrue.
.
2.  Nano Silver 10 PPM was used in experiments against Ebola virus and found to be highly effective in preventing it from entering cells and replicating, meaning that it stopped the virus.
.
This work was declassified by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States Department of Defense in 2009, making every statement by CDC, FDA, WHO and MSF that there is nothing known that can stop or prevent Ebola totally false upon this basis, as well as the one mentioned in Number 1 above.
.
3. Nano Silver 10 PPM has been approved as a hard surface cleaner by the US EPA and sanitizer precisely because it inactivates viruses, bacteria and other organisms including those of the Ebola type so its effectiveness is not only well known, but acknowledged by the US government.
.
4. This same Nano Silver 10 PPM has a singular clinical history with over 1000 published, peer reviewed articles supporting its effectiveness against a huge number of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites (including malaria) and is a nutrient, not a drug.  It has been shown to be totally safe for every member of the community, including pregnant women and infants in 8 separate peer reviewed safety studies.
.
Now the part that supports the above article.
.
5. WHO said that anything that had a chance of curing Ebola was now ethical to use on humans,, even if its safety was not proven or its efficacy was likewise unproven.  However, this particular Nano Silver 10 PPM HAS been proven effective ad HAS been proven safe.
.
Now to the issue:  Natural Solutions Foundation, of which I am proud to be the Medical Director, sent enough Nano Silver 10 PPM to Liberia for a clinical demonstration for 10 patients.  The clinical trial was halted as the first dose was being poured for the first patient by a phone call from the Deputy Minister of Health saying that the trial must not go forward BECAUSE WHO WOULD NOT PERMIT IT.
.
In Sierra Leone, the Natural Solutions Foundation sent 200 bottle and 100 tubes of sanitizer to that country when they were donated by a Sierra Leonese family.  The pallet was sent by air express cargo via Air France from the US.
.
Air France has never been able to account for its inexplicable action in NOT delivering the package, sending it back to the US THREE TIMES and finally delivering it to the wrong warehouse in New York without any paperwork more than three weeks after it was shipped.  They refused to redirect it and refused to account for it during that time.
.
The President of Sierra Leone had announced publicly that the country would use the Nano Silver 10 PPM and was told by WHO that they were not allowed to.
.
President Komoma ejected the Station Chief of WHO from his country.  None the less, WHO opposition continues unabated against the use of Nano Silver 10 PPM.
.
In Nigeria, information on the effectiveness of Nano Silver 10 PPM was presented to the President and the Minister of Health.  There was no response.
.
But a Nigerian doctor showed up with some sort of Nano Silver (not the one we know about) and was hailed as a hero for bringing it to his people  Days later, it was rejected by WHO and the government of Nigeria saying that there were ethical questions about its use.
.
What those questions were was never specified.
.
In the United States, the New York Times accused me and the Natural Solutions Foundation of being “irresponsible” for touting a “” bogus cure” for Ebola (the phrase used by the FDA about Nano Silver 10 PPM) despite the US Department of Defense research but, in the same August 16, 2014 edition, suggested, without so much as a scintilla of evidence, that Statin drugs would cure Ebola.
.
6. WHO has a stated policy of massive population reduction.  Read Agenda 21 (you can obtain a copy of it here, www.TRUTHAboutAgenda21.com if you have not yet read what that organization means by “sustainability”).
.
7. The US has a stated policy of massive population reduction first formally articulated by then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1974 in National Security Memorandum (which has never been repudiated by the US Government) which states “Population reduction must be the primary goal of US foreign policy, starting with the third world”.
.
8. Although it is legal to make Nano Silver 10 PPM available in the US, Ebay threw the Natural Solutions Foundation off their system without explaination when we listed one product and one product only: Nano Silver 10 PPM.
.
9. Yesterday, another part of the same corporation, paypal.com, told the Natural Solutions Foundation that we could either remove Nano Silver 10 PPM from our site or remove paypal.com.
.
We chose the latter.
.
Clearly, having the Ebola pandemic rage throughout Africa and the world is to someone’s liking.  And that someone is the globalist community.
.
The Natural Solutions Foundation’s principle website, www.DrRimaTruthReports.com, speaks in very detailed, and solidly researched terms about the globalists’s genocidal agenda.
.
It is not pleasant, but it is real and the only way to stop it is to make the reality public and then demand a stop to the policies that forward this genocide.
.
By the way, when you go to www.DrRimaTruthReports.com and enter your email, the Thank You letter you receive will have my Protocol for the use of Nano Silver 10 PPM against Ebola.
.
Dr. Broderick’s information is correct and we published nearly all of it over the last months.
.
Yours in health and freedom,
.
