			Knowing what we do about transmission of Ebola it would be very interesting to understand how a business trip resulted in an infection. For transmission to occur through simple hand to eye or hand to mouth assuming only casual an no intimate contact, there has to be a fairly significant prevalence of the virus circulating no?

			Uganda can test cases for Ebola locally.  Saudi Arabia sent its sample to Atlanta.  That might make a day or two delay.

I am very disappointed that we don't have a more precise history on this case as to his occupation and exposures, which might hint at the probability of confirmation.

			PLEASE test for Lassa fever virus next.  With the symptoms, exposure, and outcome of this case, the risk of a contagious VHF is high.  Lassa is endemic in Sierra Leone.
