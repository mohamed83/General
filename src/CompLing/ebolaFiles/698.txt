Local residents gather around a very sick Saah Exco, 10, in a back alley of the West Point slum in Monrovia, Liberia. The boy was one of the patients that was pulled out of a holding centre for suspected Ebola patients when the facility was overrun by a mob on Saturday

Local residents discuss how to help Saah Exco in an alley of the West Point slum on Aug. 19. Saah came with his brother, Tamba, 6, aunt Ma Hawa, and cousins, but his brother died on Friday at the isolation center. Saah fled the facility that night with several other patients before it was overrun on Saturday afternoon by looters, who stole blood-stained sheets and mattresses.

It was left to residents to care for the child. The WHO declared the West African Ebola outbreak a 'public health emergency of international concern'
