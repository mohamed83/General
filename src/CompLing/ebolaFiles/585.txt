West Point is an impoverished neighborhood in the Liberian capital of Monrovia where more than 75,000 people are packed into a small strip of peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean. A lack of clean water and sanitation facilities — the United Nations Environment Program estimates that there are just four public toilets for the entire population — has made public defecation common and long caused the spread of diseases. But where cholera and tuberculosis were once the most deadly afflictions, many fear the situation in West Point could get much worse due to the spread of Ebola.Ebola has now killed more than 2,600 people across West Africa, and approximately half the deaths have occurred in Liberia. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and the lack of treatment centers in the country is contributing to the unchecked spread of the virus. According to the World Health Organization, Liberia faces an "exponential" increase in Ebola cases in the coming weeks.VICE News traveled to West Point with an intelligence and tracking team run through an NGO called More Than Me, and followed a Red Cross body retrieval team working all around Monrovia.A health worker holds a poster warning that Ebola is real, along with a DVD featuring images of Osama Bin Laden and Nelson Mandela, in the West Point area of Monrovia, Liberia. (Photo by Tim Freccia)An Ebola victim is quarantined in his home in West Point.
