                  Ebola survivors posed for a photo upon being released from an isolation facility in Monrovia.                 

Ebola is known to Liberians as the end of life as those infested with the deadly virus see infection as the end of the journey on earth and for this reason denial about the existence of the virus is high as people do not want to be pronounced as being positive since it eventually means death.
While the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is creating awareness, informing people that early treatment can lead to survival, the statistics regarding the fatality rate of the virus standing at over 90% continues to create fear and people showing symptoms in most instances deny having the virus until death.
Ebola in Liberia has come with stigma where family members of those who die of the virus are also seen in the eyes of the public as facing the risk of carrying the virus waiting for their demise like their dead family member.
People are fearing going to hospital in order not be diagnosed with the virus, as they prefer buying drugs from pharmacies to treat themselves with the feeling that being tested Ebola positive mean automatic death. Denial and fear have been seen as two of the major reasons for the rapid spread of the virus across Liberia and people taken into isolation centers are perceived to not have the opportunity to return to their communities any longer.
Patrick Sawyer, whose travel to Nigeria led to high international attention about the virus in Liberia, from a statement released by his wife, Decontee Sawyer point to the fact that he too was perhaps involved in high denial and wanted to leave Liberia to go to a place where he could seek better medical care.
"He didn't tell me this, but I know in my heart of hearts that Patrick was determined to get to Nigeria by all means because he felt that Nigeria would be a place of refuge. He has expressed to me many times in the past that he felt passionately about helping to be a part of strengthening the Liberia's healthcare system, but he knew it wasn't there yet, and he wouldn't want to take a chance with his life because a lot of people depended on him..."
"Patrick had a passion for life, and he wouldn't have wanted his to end. So, I bet anything that he was thinking, if I could only get to Nigeria, a way more developed country than Liberia, I would be able to get some help. How ironic", Decontee expressed.
In the wave of the increase in the deaths, suspected and confirmed cases of the virus in Liberia, the fight against the virus has seen a hope in despair in less than a week with at least 14 survivors, two Americans and 12 Liberians.
Two Americans Doctors survive
On Tuesday, U.S. aid worker Nancy Writebol was discharged from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after recovering from Ebola and testing clear of the virus, missionary group Samaritan Purse said. Writebol left the hospital on Tuesday, August 19 and has since joined her husband David at an undisclosed location to rest, the group said.


She has now been followed by her fellow American Doctor, Kent Brantly who also got infested with the virus while working in Liberia and was Thursday released from the same hospital where Nancy underwent treatment.
"God saved my life," said Brantly, looking gaunt, at a press conference Thursday, at which the room applauded his appearance. He thanked his medical team and the millions of people around the world praying for his recovery. "Please do not stop praying for the people of West Africa."
Bruce Ribner, medical director of the hospital's infectious disease unit, said Brantly will go to an undisclosed location with his wife and children after the press conference. Brantly and Writebol, a volunteer with SIM USA, were flown to Emory from Liberia and were treated in the hospital's specialized unit.
Extensive tests confirm negative status
Ribner said the hospital performed extensive blood and urine tests on both patients and consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before deciding the two missionaries were ready to be released. Neither pose any risk to the public, he said.
"After a rigorous course of treatment and testing, the Emory healthcare team has determined that both patients have recovered from the Ebola virus and can return to their families and community without concern for spreading this infection to others," Ribner said.
"We are profoundly grateful for the opportunity to have applied our training, our care and our experience to meet their needs. All of us who have worked with them have been impressed by their courage and determination."
Writebol chose not to make a statement. However, Brantly related that, as she left her isolation unit, she said, "To God be the glory." Ribner said he hopes what he and his colleagues learned about treating Ebola can help save other patients in Africa.
Both Brantly and Writebol received doses of an experimental drug, called Zmapp, which includes man-made antibodies against Ebola. Although Zmapp has shown promise in animals, it has not yet been tested in humans. Experts have said it's not possible to conclude that Zmapp cured their disease, although getting good supportive care at Emory, one of the world's best hospitals, likely improved their chances of survival.
Samaritan's Purse, the Christian humanitarian organization for which Brantly works, released this statement from its president, Franklin Graham, Thursday morning:
