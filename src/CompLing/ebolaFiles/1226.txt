Prof. Yoseph Shaalitiel to TV Channel 2” “We can produce as much ZMapp as required to combat the Ebola epidemic in West Africa”
 

Professor Yoseph Shaaltiel, Protalix Executive VP Research and Development told ITV Channel 2 News that his company can immediately begin producing the experimental anti-Ebola ZMapp drug, the only drug that has proven to be an effective Ebola cure.
Dr. Kent Brantly, the American doctor who contracted the disease while treating Ebola patients in Liberia made a rapid recovery after being given the drug.

Unfortunately the drug is still in an experimental stage, and experiments done after Dr. Brantly was treated exhausted supplies.
The manufacturer, Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., a small San Diego based biotech company requires several months before they can manufacture a new batch of the drug.
Protalix, located in the northern Israeli town of Karmiel has developed biological agents effective in combatting Gauchr disease and Fabry disease.  The company’s technology can also be used to rapidly produce a broad range of antibodies and anti-viral agents, including the active ingredients in ZMapp.
At the moment it is unclear whether there is any other company in the world capable of rapidly producing large amounts of the biological materials ZMapp requires.
However Protalix would have to reach an agreement with Mapp before it could commence production of the ZMapp formula. It is unknown whether there have been any talk between the companies regarding this issue.
