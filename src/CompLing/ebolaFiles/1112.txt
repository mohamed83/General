YoungAntoinette W. YoungShared publicly  -  2014-09-10 EBOLA UPDATE:"This one is too big"! This was the exact statement made by Dr. Monica the head for infectious disease World Health Organization WHO, comparing the Liberia Ebola experience with other countries with Ebola outbreak. My recent post on the Banjour cases brought in the WHO today. We spent the entire day in the field with Rep.Dakel, the Governor, Muslim and community leaders, doing awareness and sending more infected people to the treatment center. It's frustrating again to know that all of the centers combined could not accommodate more than five infected people. We had to choose people who were very very sick. , we also had a 7 year old and a 9 month old who lost both parents to Ebola and the 7 year old has to take care of the 9 month old, heart breaking! And they are already down with the virus. My concern is: for the past one month I have called the deputy minister of health in charge of the Ebola crisis in Liberia and cannot get him to answer the phone, I sent text no response, but the WHO responded.The health ministry has no presence in these areas. Responsibilities have been shared but the health ministry is not performing and the International Health Organizations are burdened and frustrated! If we don't have the guts to dismiss people who are making this situation worst than we cannot manage this crisis. We need to cut off the many meetings and get in the field, it's not easy out there. From my experience OUTSOURCING is the way. We can serve as counterparts to learn. Also, the dismissal of the health minister is overdue.﻿2014-09-105 photosAntoinette W. Young's photos1Add a comment...
