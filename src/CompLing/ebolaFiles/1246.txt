Interim guidance: Ebola event management at points of entrypdf, 518 KB






Overview
 As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) continues to claim lives and put pressure on health systems in west Africa, its transmission across borders has prompted a need to manage suspected cases at Points of Entry (PoE).
 The interim guidance document is intended for National Focal Points for the International Health Regulations (IHR)(2005)(1), PoE public health authorities, PoE operators, conveyance operators, crew members and other stakeholders involved in the management of Public health event.

 The aim is to provide early detection of potentially infected persons; to assist in implementing WHO recommendations related to Ebola management; and to prevent the international spread of the disease while allowing PoE authorities to avoid unnecessary restrictions and delays.
