The popular Lagos pastor, Prophet Temitope Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nations(SCOAN) has played down the popular acceptance of the Ebola outbreak as another emerging problem for Nigeria.

In a Press Release by the church, T. B. Joshua said Insecurity remains our major problem and that is what the Government should focus majorly on for now.

Below is the Press Statement:

IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM T.B. JOSHUA CONCERNING EBOLA
 
 “The world at large is full of fear. People want to read about things 
in newspapers and watch things on the television that cause fear. There 
is another news, apart from Boko Haram, that is causing fear in Nigeria -
 Ebola. Ebola is not Nigeria's challenge. We should not be hasty in 
considering it a challenge.  Our challenge is insecurity. It is a
 strange ailment. Imagine you carry an almond tree from Europe to 
Nigeria to plant it. It will not grow because of the weather.   
“That someone came from another country for an ECOWAS meeting and died 
of Ebola does not mean Nigeria is not safe. It is good to secure our 
nation, our environment but my concern is that we are going too far. It 
is affecting the image of the nation outside Nigeria. It is giving this 
nation a bad image, to the detriment of the name Nigeria.   “To 
the extent we talk bad about Nigeria, to that same extent our name is 
destroyed. This is a country under repair because of what Boko Haram has
 done to the nation Nigeria.  Don’t damage it more. This nation is safe.
 If there is any challenge, we have what it takes to surmount it. 
 “All of this is propaganda. When a little thing happens, you exaggerate
 it because you are looking for funds. How much can the international 
community give to us that can redeem the name Nigeria we are soiling? A 
beggar always remains a beggar. Africa, stop begging – you have what it 
takes to solve your problem.  “What is the meaning of African 
unity? The wound of an African is the wound of all Africans. The wound 
of one is the wound of all. A nation that stands to solve the problem of
 other nations will become successful. Successful people are problem 
solvers.  “There is nothing bad in securing your nation using 
every proper means and educating your citizens. That does not mean you 
should use it to destroy the name of Nigeria as if it is here. It’s not!
 Protection and prevention – that should be our assignment in Nigeria.”
