It is immediately apparent that the deepest convective clouds were not responsible for the heavy rains: cloud-top IR brightness temperatures over Islip were only near -30ยบ C (per the 1200 UTC OKX sounding, that was around 300 hPa; the tropopause was closer to 150 hPa) and cloud-to-ground lightning was not detected.
