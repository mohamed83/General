"What you're seeing is a disaster done by that so-called little rain storm we had last night, and it inundated our boiler room and in our church, it's about eight inches," said Sal Basile, a senior warden.The church doesn't have flood insurance because leaders say it's simply too much money, a $300,000 premium because they're so close to the ocean.Rather than get upset about the loss, members kept the mood light hearted believing God will yet again provide.
