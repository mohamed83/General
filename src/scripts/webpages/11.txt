                        Lavrov, Fabius: the tragedy in Paris confirms need for action in fighting terrorism                     





A number of European leaders expressed their readiness to join the rally in protest against Islamist terrorists’ actions. Heads of state and government from Belgium, Great Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland were among the politicians saying they would join the silent march for national unity on French President Francois Hollande’s invitation. European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, European Parliament President Martin Schulz, European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also announced their plans to come to the French capital. Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko said he would also attend.
Hollande called the rally after three days of terrorist attacks which killed seventeen people, including 10 staff members of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, four hostages taken at a kosher grocery, and three policemen. Several dozen people were injured.
