What We Know So Far


U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Paris to meet with French officials, and pay his respects to those who lost their lives in last week’s terror attacks.
At least 10 people were arrested in Paris during terror raids overnight on Thursday. The city’s Gare de l’Est station was evacuated following a bomb scare on Friday morning.
A news photographer was injured during clashes in Karachi, Pakistan over Charlie Hebdo.
Funerals for those who died in the attacks on the offices of Charlie Hebdo have been taking place on Thursday and Friday.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula — a branch in Yemen — claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo massacre in a video released Wednesday.
The new issue of the newspaper — depicting the Prophet Muhammad holding a sign saying “Je Suis Charlie” — went on sale Wednesday.
The original 3-million-copy run was extended to 5 million on Wednesday. The distributor told BuzzFeed News that copies would remain on sale until March.
Authorities are still searching for Hayat Boumedienne, the alleged accomplice and widow of Amedy Coulibaly, one of the attackers. She reportedly crossed into Syria shortly after the attacks.
Last week, 17 people and three gunmen died during a series of attacks on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris and a kosher deli and a print shop outside the city.

One of the brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre has been secretly buried in an unmarked grave in Reims, France.

Said Kouachi had lived in Reims before the terrorist attack. The city’s mayor had been opposed to the move, fearing the grave would become a shrine for extremists, but said he had been legally forced to allow the burial, the BBC reported. 
“Given the risk of disturbance of the peace and in order to quickly turn the page of this tragic episode, it was decided to do the burial quickly,” Reims city officials said in a statement.
His widow did not attend the funeral, fearing journalists would follow her and discover the location of the grave, the BBC reported.
His brother, Cherif, is expected to be buried in Gennevilliers, outside Paris.
The brothers were killed by police on Jan. 9, two days after the attack on the satirical newspaper that killed 12 people. 
No plans have been revealed for the burial of Amedy Coulibaly, the man suspected of killing a policewoman, as well as four hostages inside a kosher supermarket.




















Two Frenchmen have been detained in Yemen on suspicion of having ties to al-Qaeda, police have told Agence France-Presse.

“During the past two days, two French nationals accused of belonging to Al-Qaeda have been arrested,” national security service chief General Mohammed al-Ahmadi told AFP.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has a stronghold in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper.
Attackers Said and Chérif Kouachi were also said to have received training with the terrorist organization in Yemen.




















Anti-Charlie Hebdo protests turned violent Friday in Muslim nations, leaving at least 4 people dead.

In Niger, four people were killed and dozens more injured Friday when angry demonstrators torched a French cultural center and Christian churches over the latest Charlie Hebdo issue’s depiction of the Prophet Muhammad, the country’s interior minister said.
The protests took place in the West African country’s second-largest city of Zinder, where armed crowds burned French flags, attacked Christian shops, and ransacked the homes of police officers, Reuters reported.
“The protesters are crying out in local Hausa language: ‘Charlie is Satan — let hell engulf those supporting Charlie,’” Aboubacar Mamane, a shopkeeper, told the news agency.
One police officer and three protesters were killed in the clashes, and at least 40 others were injured, the AP reported.
“Zinder experienced a quasi-insurrectional situation, a spontaneous protest of a criminal nature,” interior minister Hassoumi Massaoudou said. “I would like to reassure Christians that the state is here to defend those living in Niger at all costs.”

In Pakistan, a photographer for Agence France-Presse (AFP) was shot and seriously injured while covering an anti-Charlie Hebdo demonstration Friday as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the French consulate in Karachi.
The crowd of students, some of whom were armed, shouted and opened fire on police, an officer told the AP. Police fired shots in the air and used water cannons and tear gas in return. Three people, including two journalists, were injured in the melee.
At a protest in Islamabad, demonstrators carried signs that read “Shame on Charlie Hebdo,” and “If you are Charlie, then I am Kouachi,” referring to the brothers who killed 12 people in the attack on the Paris publication.
In Algeria, thousands of protesters marched in the streets carrying banners that read, “I am not Charlie, I am Muhammad,” chanted slogans from a banned Islamist party, and set fire to a state airline office.
Several officers were injured as protesters hurled objects at police, who responded with tear gas.

Thousands protested against the satirical cartoons in the Jordanian capital Amman Friday in demonstrations organized by the Muslim Brotherhood. Clashes broke out between the crowds and police as protesters tried to march toward the French embassy, the AP reported.
The nation’s royal family said Charlie Hebdo’s latest depiction of Muhammad was “irresponsible and far from the essence of freedom of expression.”




















Amid violent protests, Pakistan’s parliament passed a resolution condemning may cartoons in Charlie Hebdo.

According to Sojho Khabar:

Pakistan parliament on Thursday adopted a unanimous resolution against blasphemous caricatures published by French sarcastic magazine Charlie Hebdo, saying it is a deliberate attempt to “widen misunderstandings among civilizations” and incite violence.
The resolution tabled in the National Assembly or the lower house said: “These cartoons are a conspiracy to widen misunderstanding among civilizations.”
It also said ridiculing of religion is “condemnable” and termed it against the freedom of speech.

People protesting the Charlie Hebdo cover in Karachi, Pakistan clashed with police forces on Friday, and an AFP photographer was injured, according to several news outlets.

Reuters reported:
“AFP photographer Asif Hasan suffered wounds resulting from gunshots fired by … protesters, police have not opened fire,” Abdul Khalique Shaikh, a senior police officer in southern Karachi, told Reuters.
Some outlets reported that the protesters belonged to Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba (IJT) and that police used water cannons to disperse the crowd, who were throwing stones.
A policeman and television cameraman were also injured, according to Geo TV News, which reports it was at the scene.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Paris to meet with senior members of the French government.

Early on Friday, Kerry met with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, before giving President Francois Hollande a hug as they met outside his Elysee presidential palace, Reuters reported. 
Speaking in Bulgaria yesterday, Kerry had said Paris needed “a big hug.”
Kerry told President Hollande:
“I think you know that you have the full and heartfelt condolences of the American people and I know you know that we share the pain and the horror of everything that you went through. Our hearts go out to you.”
The Obama administration did not send a senior official to Sunday’s unity march in Paris, and has since admitted that this was an oversight.




















At least ten people have been arrested across Paris overnight Thursday following a series of raids linked to gunmen with possible Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) ties, AP reported.

The Paris prosecutor’s office said ten people with links to the gunman who held up a kosher supermarket last week were taken into custody.
An official cited by Reuters said that the number arrested overnight was 12.


The city’s Gare de l’Est train station was also evacuated following a bomb alert early on Friday morning.

An official cited by AP who did not wish to be named said the station was shut down as a “precaution”.
Police in Berlin, Germany also conducted terror raids overnight, arresting a Turkish man thought to be the leader of an extremist group believed to be planning an attack in Syria, AFP reported.
Police said there was no indication the group was planning an attack in Germany.
A Western intelligence source has told CNN that the ongoing terror threat in Europe appears to involve 20 sleeper cells made up 120 to 180 people.
The official said the groups are ready to launch attacks in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and that Middle East and European Union intelligence agencies has identified “imminent threats” to Belgium and possibly the Netherlands.
Yesterday, two people died in an anti-terror operation in Belgium.




















Hundreds gathered for Charlie Hebdo staff funerals in France.

Cartoonists Bernard “Tignous” Verlhac and Georges Wolinski as well as columnist Elsa Cayat were buried on Thursday.




















France’s cybersdefense chief has said that 19,000 websites in the country have been hit by cyberattacks since the terror attacks on Paris last week, AP reported.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Adm. Arnaud Coustilliere said that many of the attacks had been carried out by “more or less structured” groups, including some well-known Islamist hacking collectives.
He said: “That’s never been seen before. It’s the first time that a country has been faced with such a large wave.”
The attacks were mostly small denial-or-services attacks, Coustilliere said. They have affected sites ranging from pizza shops to military regiments.




















Pope Francis has spoken about Charlie Hebdo during his visit to the Philippines today, saying there is a limit to freedom of expression when it comes to faith.

He said: “One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people’s faith, one cannot make fun of faith.”

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to arrive in Paris later Thursday.

The U.S. came under criticism for not sending a high-level official to Sunday’s unity rally, which featured many world leaders.
Speaking in Bulgaria Thursday, Kerry said he wanted to give Paris a “big hug.” The Straits Times said:
“My visit to France is basically to share a big hug for Paris and express our affection for France … and the people in Paris who have gone through a terrible time,” Kerry said in Bulgaria.
He said he may meet the Iranian foreign minister while there.
