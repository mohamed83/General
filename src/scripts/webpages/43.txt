MQM strongly condemns the Paris Terror Attack














 Posted on: 1/8/2015 1





MQM, one of the largest parties of Pakistan with a strong  liberal and anti-extremism agenda has condemned the attack on the Paris office of Charlie Hebdo magazine in which 12 people died and several others were injured.
Strongly condemning the attack, MQM’s chief, Mr. Altaf Hussain said, “This was an act of barbaric terrorism. I strongly condemn the attack and my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the French people & government”.
MQM has been raising its concerns for past three decades, on the rising wave of religious intolerance, extremism and terrorism in the world, particularly in Pakistan. MQM due to this liberal stance has suffered a huge loss of its hundreds of workers including four sitting lawmakers, who were killed by the Taliban and their allies.
