Terrorists breached into "Charlie Hebdo » newspaper's headquarter and shot several cartoon artists, journalists and two policemen. Disgusted and also shocked, we can't fall down, it is our responsibility to react.We are all affected by the death of Cabu, Charb, Tignous and Wolinski, talented artists who were murdered for their opinions and the freedom of their newspaper."Charlie Hebdo", historical figure of satirical journalism has been targeted by cowards.Anonymous has always fought for the freedom of speech and freedom of the press. We will never stop.Anonymous must remind every citizen that the freedom of the press is fundamental to all democracy. It is everyone’s responsibility to defend it. We always fought for the freedom of speech. We will not give in.Attacking freedom of speech is attacking Anonymous. We will not permit it. Any organisations or enterprises linked to those terrorists attacks should expect a massive reaction from Anonymous. We are tracking you down.
