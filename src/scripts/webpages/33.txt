Hacker group Anonymous have released a video and a statement via Twitter 
  condemning the
attacks on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people, including eight 
  journalists, were murdered. 


The video description says that it is "a message for al-Qaeda, the 
  Islamic State and other terrorists", and was uploaded to the group's 
  Belgian account. 


In the clip, a figure wearing the group's symbolic Guy Fawkes mask is seated 
  in front of a desk with the hashtag #OpCharlieHebdo - which stands for 
  Operation Charlie Hebdo - featured on screen. 


The figure, whose voice is obscured says: "We are declaring war against 
  you, the terrorists."


They add that the group will track down and close all accounts on social 
  networks related to terrorists in order to avenge those who have been 
  killed.

This is backed up with a statement entitled "a message to the enemies of 
  freedom of expression" posted 
  to Pastebin, the hacker collective offered their condolences 
  to "the families of the victims of this cowardly and despicable act". 

They write "freedom of expression has suffered inhuman assault ... and it 
  is our duty to react". 


Anonymous are a group comprised of activists and hackers who claim to defend 
  and protect democracy. 


In the past the group have carried out cyber attacks on government, religious, 
  and corporate websites by distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks which 
  attempt to overwhelm an online service with traffic from numerous sources so 
  that users can no longer access it.
