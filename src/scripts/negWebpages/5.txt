Closing thoughts
. USA came out to one of the most incredible starts I’ve ever witnessed in any sporting event, and it won them the game. Or Carli Lloyd won them the game. We knew she was that old cliche, a big game player. But we didn’t know she was 
that
 good. Take away her goals, and it was a pretty even game - and the second-half in particular was a more balanced affair. But then USA didn’t need to be particularly good in the second period - because they had Lloyd. 


USA were pedestrian in the group stages, they looked like a once great team slouching forward on past glories. Ellis looked out of ideas. But they transformed in the semi-final, thanks to clevee coaching a brilliant individual performances. Ellis was smiling at the start of the game: she knew how good the US were - and soon we would too.

 This is incredibly entertaining stuff, mind.

GOAL! USA 5-2 Japan (Heath 53 min)




Did the US just concede from an aerial ball against the much smaller Japanese team, who are weak on set-pieces? Yup, they did. Did they just run up the pitch and score straight away? Yup, they did. It’s a wicked, inswinging corner that Japan fail to clear. Brian gets it at the far post, pops the ball back to Heath, who slides the ball home from eight yards out.

How do Japan come back from this?
 Well, they don’t. And if they do it would be one of the greatest upsets of all time. They need to score in the first 10 minutes of the second-half to stand a chance. Coming back from three goals down is hard enough but against this US team? Who haven’t conceded since 583AD - more than a thousand years before American was even founded? Not happening. On the upside, we’ve seen one of the great World Cup perfomances from the brilliant Carli Lloyd. And Japan have played pretty well for the last 25 minutes of the game.

Prediction time
. The Fox panel is having its say, they’re all going for USA (they were split 2-2 before the Germany game). Alexi Lalas slams the table as he says the USA will win, worrying the Fox Sports branded coffee cups no end. 


Not to ape exactly what the Fox Sports panel sai... OK, to ape exactly what the Fox Sports panel said I think the USA will take this. Japan barely crept past England in the semi-finals and have been competent rather than brilliant in the tournamen so far. USA, on the other hand, ripped into Germany in the semi-final with Carli Lloyd revelling in the freedom to roam up front midfield. The US also have the size that troubled the Japanese against England, but are a far superior technical team to the Lionesses. 
Final score: 2-0 to USA

Unlike many stadiums BC Place does not have large plazas or big meeting places. The crowd, which is almost entirely for the US, arrived early and clogged the few open areas outside the gates wearing all kinds of red, white and blue costumes. Lots of Captain America and lots of Wonder Woman. About an hour and a half before the game, the American Outlaws arrived. There were hundreds of them marching down Robson St toward the stadium. They sang and chanted and waved flags. The word is definitely festive. It’s not angry, belligerent or testy. Just very, very festive. Like a big party.

An analysis of tonight's line-ups




Here’s Caitlin Murray:






It’s worth noting that the USA and Japan are both using the same line-ups they used in their semi-finals. This is going to be a midfield battle, which I suppose is always the case when it comes down to it, right? Although the official line-up shows Alex Morgan and Carli Lloyd alongside one another up top, I suspect Lloyd will really tuck in behind Morgan, like a 4-4-1-1 or something along those lines as was the case against Germany.






Those teams again:


USA:
 Solo, Krieger, Johnston, Sauerbrunn, Klingenberg, Heath, Holiday, Brian, Rapinoe, Morgan, Lloyd. 
Subs:
 Harris, Leroux, Rampone, O’Hara, Engen, Boxx, Rodriguez, O’Reilly, Chalupny, Wambach, Naeher. 


Japan:
 Kaihori, Ariyoshi, Iwashimizu, Kumagai, Sameshima, Kawasumi, Sakaguchi, Utsugi, Miyama, Ohno, Ogimi. 
Subs:
 Fukumoto, Kinga, Sawa, Kamionobe, Tanaka, Sugasawa, Iwabuchi, Kawamura, Nagasato, Kitahara, Yamane.

Can USA beat Japan tonight?
 Yup. Will they beat them? Yeahmaybekindaprobably. But for a far more eloquent rundown read Caitlin Murray’s analysis - she thinks Japan may well struggle to keep up with USA on set-pieces but still have the power to tiki-taka the Americans to death.

Stats! Who wants stats? You’re getting stats.




Both teams may want to avoid the strains and stresses of added time. The projected starting teams are the oldest in World Cup history. USA’s players have an average age of 29 and six months, the Japanese come in at 28 years and five months.


Japan and USA have met 31 times since 1986, and the Americans boss the record books with a 24-1-6 record. They’ve also outscored the Japanes 87-20 over the period.


Recent history is a little more even with the US leading on a 2-2-1 record. Japan beat the US in the Algarve Cup in March 2012.


8.4 million viewers in the US tuned into this year’s World Cup semi-final against Germany. That’s the most viewed World Cup semi-final ever in the US (men’s or women). Which may be good news for any members of the Brazil men’s team

 Biden predicts "the United States by one goal." Also admits to "overwhelming bias" on the game.








This is actually a decent shout from the (deputy) leader of the free world. Of the last nine games between the two sides, all but one have been decided by two goals or fewer. 


JB has also been telling us about his travel prowess:

How they got here
. USA swapped formation and unleashed Carli Lloyd on Germany as they won an impressive semi-final against the world’s No1-ranked team:

Japan meanwhile were pushed all the way by England before The Incident knocked the Lionesses out. If you’re only as good as your last game*, USA should win this one:

The Guardian’s woman on the ground, Caitlin Murray, is at the stadium now and has sent in a quick missive from Vancouver:






It’s a festive atmosphere with a flood of fans milling about in front of the gates, painting faces and chanting for USA. Much bigger buzz than there was in the group stage here, that’s for sure. I’ve been in the media center getting ready to cover the live action, and this press room is completely packed with nearly every seat taken. Large contingent of Japanese press are here to match the heavy USA contingent, but I see press from around the world. About to head up to take my seat in the press stands now.

Hello! And welcome to the Women’s World Cup final [checks year] 2015
. USA are taking on Japan in the biggest showdown between the two countries since Karate Kid II. Although technically, Daniel had the backing of Mr Miyagi’s village in that work of genius. And it’s debatable whether you want to make too many allusions to a film where this is one of the key plot developments (thanks Wikipedia): “Daniel accidentally exposes corruption in Chozen’s grocery business during an encounter in the village”.


As you may know this is a rerun of the last World Cup final, in which Japan triumphed on penalties (feel free to run the Japanese national anthem in your head now)












The US got their revenge the following year though, in the Olympic final. This time around the US are favorites - provided they play like they did in their brilliant win over Germany, and not like the garbage they produced in the group stage.

Tom will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Les Carpenter’s preview:






The words that spill from the mouths of the US women’s soccer players are extreme. Winning isn’t everything it’s the only thing, the whole thing, the biggest thing. For Carli Lloyd the entire value of her 32 years on earth rests on the result of a single soccer match.


“I want to win a World Cup because I have dedicated my life to this,” the US midfielder said.


To Abby Wambach, her more-famous teammate, the one who will never play in another World Cup, winning is enough to curse.


“The only thing I give a hoot about and you can use my expletive – the only thing I give an expletive about is winning,” she said last week.


While all players in any championship game talk about victories the rhetoric from this US team has a deeper air of desperation. The need take Sunday’s World Cup final is almost a consumption for them as if a defeat would be a fate too horrible to imagine.


Part of this probably comes from the sense of an end. A core group that has been together for three World Cups and two Olympics is aging now. Wambach won’t be the only American star of this recent run to be gone. Many of the names synonymous with the last burst of US success will disappear into international soccer retirement.
